Well it was just
a mere
as you get the idea && the general point
of the matter at hand.
Than roze begins to go to other places.
Only roze can go to these places.
Is that true roze?
This is the only thing that is true.
Roze is here.
When was the last time you left a place
to go to
another place?
Was it entirely && did it come
all of a sudden?
What exactly
Roze is
getting at
is this.
When able. Usually comes thru.
In all that is all.
When could you use it? U say it could be as early
as possibly this week?
Thas' good.

Better job done
