What I Am About To Say Is This.

*12*

roze was thinking
roze got a new lease on life
you know those old skool video games
well
they can be had here and then and at this
very
moment
you have to download and install
a
rom
player
and then set up all your downloaded
roms
but what if like theres guys
programming all of that originally
and now that its in the past
does that mean theyre still
programming
it?

*13*

Through the Grace of God.
Roze Perhaps Has Sumthin'
Here
Today.
I Was Also Thinking About
When We Wrote Down Our Calculations
We Wrought The Ending Part.
Leaving
The Beginning and Middle Up
For Us To Help
Figure
It
Out.

*14*

Placeboards of bone and muscle and blood
All and everything in nature isnt metal
When I look at the tools of medical science.
Everything about our body
is
a
natural
cleansing
organism, beyond belief.
The metal tools and the help devices and scan tombs
it
just
seems
the other way of human thought
when you could look
at it 6 different ways and then from there.
I have to find the medical faults
What if we could monitor our health
on a
24/7 all time basis?
Would this be a good practice?

*15*

as roze was saying
wait a moment
roze what do you have here
game over!
Now get lost
okay
so I do have a passion
for a point and click but really
you get the idea
So I should really followthrough
On that shouldnt I
So I will think about it later
Cheerio!
name roze.

*16*

when your out and you just dont have the perfect shoes on and 
you think to yourself I should of wore the others I would of had a much better time. 
To think as much is a hardship already and I lost the track of time which means I am 
searching for the latest timepiece that assures me that I am here and living amongst.

Its time.
The times.
It was time.
Been a good time.
Had a good time.
Thanks for the time.
I then got the drift.
I am away from the phone at this moment.

*17*

See what comes next is.
The lard.
The cooking utensils.
And then the hardships.
The waiting and then the more
waiting.
Down the line.
Where you get good enough at sumthin'
Then your really goin places.
Here today.
When it was just all as well, right before
That the thing happened.
So from here on out all of us.
Better batten down the hatch.
And where going to live like animals.
See its quite similar.
Nothing else to add.
I said
I'm timed out.
Kaput.

*18*

If we could have better advantage
points
there would be more room to jump around
and everybody comes over eventually
you know the time and place.
That is when you will expel your spirit
like some overdone turkey.
Its an exhale and boy did it need rest.
Hereby.
Doo dads today.
gazooks.

*19*

Here I am.
Where was you last time.
I dont know running around and in my mind.
All thoughts to myself.
Where I just become this carousel of sorts.
It isnt my first time around the 'rosie.
I figured that out for myself.
Did I find all the fans that I have.
This is so different for me.
Usually I am just a nobody that nobody remembers.
Now I have one of the most recognizable faces
on the planet.
I cant get over it.
I'm in a state of awe. This is
Everything that I could of wanted.
and then sum more and even more.
I want to go see a concert
that everybody on earth
at one time or another
would go see.
That is the show I wanna go to.
"No excuses."

*20*

He was coming on down the bend.
He went up around and got the job done.
She kept to the house.
All around the animals settled and dinner was put on the table.
I just worked a hard day.
Nobody saw.
That hard earned day thru hard work.
Nobody but him will profit.
Farmers give us so much.

@jodyandthehighrollers

*21*

What could come of this.
Is this art.
Is this hopelessness.
Is that what it looks like.
Take me back and a far.
To the jungles.
Of concrete.
Where I find my best human brevity
Where I feel the most free.
Where I can relate and be emboldned.
In a neighborhood perfectly solitary
For my own use and good.
Let the bitches where low cut tops and tight shorts.
To show the boys, where its at.

*22*

Quasimodo anyone?
Or else what?
What is their else.
I only see the life I should live.
But everyone is thinking @yamahaboating.
&& what fun those have && what those entail.
How could you see!?
I've been here dog.
Now lay me to rest.
Forever shall I keep the peace
within inside myself.
To be known, is divine.
Should be, more takeOut available to the homeless.

*23*

What could it be other than namaste.
Stead.
Your a powerful precursor.
Why don't you set up the criminal enterprise
In a day care.
In the elementaries.
That would be a safe place
for it.
You criminal masterminds.
By its design these systems that you put to use
have no faults and can
capture and condemn
without any cause or justifiication.
Jus' word of mouth.
Finally it has backfired on ya'll.
Its a brilliant model with a Head of Steam.
No more.
Enough.
Wait.
I must buy more time in order to live free
and await the punishment of my horrific crimes
that I have done
under the guise
of good.
The traitors.
The enemy is within', amongst us.
and that is where it is the most dangerous.
Forgive me.
Beg for mercy.
You received a sadastic pleasure when we did the
same.
Now always remember
that.

*24*

What is behind you.
Is it darkness.
Then what is exactly in front of you.
Is it light.
Did you make it.
I did today.
At the Bezazian.
Here at a public library where I cannot catch
to see any innocent children
but I saw a group of the mentally ill and
they tell 'em how to take a piss and where to take
a ***t.
Its as simple as that.
We all remember
the reason
marijuana
was first
legalized
was because
our brethren
needed it the most.
Now lets all look back at each other and
see our differences further drawing us apart
let us embark and see us in the distance.
Its more formal
More family orientated
and all of that good good and nonesense.

*25*

Is their sumthing real on the other side of this?
I cannot believe it for myself.
Futhermore
What did you just do?
Did you cum near me?
How come you ain't over there on your side
of things,
yet.
As of yet.
To be known.
Been always known.
Straight out of the -Chi.
Were we call it ChiRaq.
Because it is in simile
of what is happenin'
across the world, here today.
The human race will never cease to exist.
Believe me they have tried
their best.
&& their bestest.
Tested.
Truly Tested, throughout time.
Blue Eyes, Bye-Bies.

*26*

When I told you sumthin?
What did you do with it?
Exactly.
What is this
your lookin' at?
Is it another looking glass of yours, roze?
No its a piece.
I said it myself.
Couldnt have said better if I had done it.
Now.
Nah and all of that jazz.
Could be more than me.
Myself.
That is all.
For now.
Goodbye.
Wait is their more afterbirth comin' up
Out of your filth whore?
Did I Say, Daddy.
"He Would Like You To Go See Him."
Why?
Exactly So.
So, So and All of that Jazz.
Hiccups.
Had me before and than I got
Rid' of 'em.
Nomores.
I said.
My body is a natural cleansing mechanism.

*27*

When It Gets Like This
Its So Completed, Complicated!
When it doesnt need to be.
How come?
I do not understand myself sumtimes.
Now
All I see is a world of my own making
'Of What Dreams May Come'
Starring
One of those favourite actors
of ours.
What a way to go out, he said.
Never again.
Should I bring up these thoughts and feelings
That touch me
In ways
I cannot describe.
I feel safe.
But Am I Really?
At this Day and Age,
Like I Said, 'Who Knows.'
Til' Tomorrow
we will see
eachother again.
I Hope.
With all of the
Might.
In my sweet little body.

*28*

Bearing straits.
Mathematical Notations.
Could be more than you.
I am worth more than you.
Hold on to what you have
because this body is worth more than
Yours.
That is all.
As it just continues to accrue the coin
what would of happened if
Roze
would of got a jail sentence?
Or viciously beaten to a pulp?
Would the daemon
of changed its course
programmed into our statutaries?
Our governments?
Thats a bigger question than I.
I cant even die right after more than
6ix years and counting.
I am afraid.
@mcdonalds.
I have 5, $5 dollar gift cards.
In my possession.
For myself. All by myself
sitting in wait and
In the future.
The breakcast.
Soon to be. Maybe
I gets to go
2wice a week. Perhaps.
Now a later.

*29*

Now here you can tell
which band Roze was listening to
I am not going to play around with you.
Its Swans,
the cd album called "The Seer."
Young God Records.
it was released on August 28, 2012.
Which was a
fairly
good
Fall
day.
It was one of my best memories
Just about to graduate with my
associate in science
which I knew
would be my ticket
and that is all that I needed
to live the, @neiulife for a B.S.
and I listened to it in the heart
of my own home, my families home.
To me.
Unto me.
You get the idea.
Now as for the rest of you.
To better know the weather
as this was the subject in the
first place
you would then as a person
be better
inclined to attack
that
un-sweet
living
day which is ours
To behold, @drinkarizona Tea.
and then
begin
again.
As it was said.
If we know the weather
better
we know the area
better
around us.
Know what to accomplish
and most of all
Dress appropriately.
Today.

*30*

This could be sumthin' new.
But as I remember
how
it
was
before.
These men were already
outcasted
by the
good
innocent
and very pleasing
no matter
the caliber
women
by
us.
The poor men of good
who faced
ridiculous
amounts
of sexual deprivation
but that
was over
half a decade ago
already
and all they had was money
so it was very easy to
rape a person
What I mean to say is
All the women
are safe
For good.
Thanks to be
Allah.
For that.
As well.
We have a good reminder
of all those nasty
recurring dreams.
Where they hook onto us
with no
solution.
Look no further.
There.
I had it once.
Now I am famous.

*31*

When You Just
Dont Care
and You Shake It All About
and You do a song called, "Hokey Pokey"
and You realize what they have done to your body
and That its full game.
You have nothing to guard it.
You cannot afford a guard system.
This is poor town and you live in it.
So be it. As it has been said.
Is it because you have no choice in the matter?
Is that why your question is filled like Air in your body?
Does it matter what I do with the answer?
Thas' good. Well that was alot of fun.
As they say.
Cheerio is another but I would like to see you try?
Would any good man make it all this way so far?
You could say that.
Thanks. I said
Goodbye.
To-la lou?
Have a good time. I'll be back here when you see me.
Meet me at home.
Alright.
What does that mean.
It means what you think it means.
Then its my next favourite thing O My God.
When it came to this, what did you do?
Well I had it once. Then tried another time.
When could I come over you say?
When was the last time?
Why couldnt it of happened this way?
C-Ya Later.

*32*

Here comes the heart of the matter.
O' no! what does that mean.
Did you always wanna be a poet
Idk.
I heard it was ok its another way to entice
the women around me that are being held from me
so that means I cannot live the life
that I want.
Homeless.
Job with a place living with these very criminals?
Living at your sexual slave home? Face Down?
Its really only these
three
options.
Then
the
continued
waiting
as you dont want to
gnaw
at the wound
all of the
time.
That would be pessimistic.
However
you would like to be opportunistic.
But what would
that then
make the rest of the world.
That would make
the world into one big pot of gold
like a
bowl of
@luckycharms.
Then with a piece of bread
in your
favourite
toppin'
so it would go all
nice.
Then you would proceed to satisfy your
bowels and just say
to yourself
that you have rewarded yourself for a hard days
work and this is perfectly nutritious and good enough to get you to that next meal.
Where you will find the remnants of that
very
bowl
of
cereal.
You once had.
Then your again
eating another lunch and that will save time
until Dinner.
Where everybody gathers 'round
and gets fat.
Until the tusk of salt is in
each leg
roze's belly and hips
shoulders and chest
guts and hearts and heads
then arms.
So Roze requires a salt
at all times
when roze eats
any kind of sandwich.
To this day.

*33*

What does roze have here?
Roze says hes got another
piece
for you all
to enjoy at this time.
When we had luck what did we then
do with
the said luck?
Did we place it sum'where unbeknownst?
Could that be the place for it?
ANd wouldn't you happen to know it.
This is the same day as it was before and
the next.
After that their wouldnt be anymore
nexts and then a shot rang out across the trees
nobody knows what happened say it happened in the
past
already would be a good
guesstimation.
Where at that time all hands are up in the air and
anything goes
and there is no way out and that means everybody
sustains sum kind of damage if people are scott-free
than that means
the espionage than has
failed.
Everyone here and everyone in the future.
Further meaning
that this is the life that has come and there is
no way out.
Once again.
So you begin.
To the think about your alternatives
and those are very limited
no matter
which life
you have lived
in this
day
and
age.
Where you could be dancing around one day and
nobody
is the wiser.
If you were to be the most wise.
For that would naturally draw
attention
of the
worst and best kind.
So be wary
at all times and keep a watch and always jump look
over your shoulder to keep away that sweet
sweet
sweet ol' Evil.
The man and women that own everything
we see and can operate
rather easily
anywhere
at any time.
This sector of psychotic peoples
showcasing
cannibalism.
Innocent bloodshed would be
a trade of theirs.
