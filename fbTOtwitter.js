Dubai, is very popular these days. Tokyo is very movie popular these days. Roze wanted to goto his homeland, Helsinki, Finland. 
Maybe even entertain sum developer roles. Ouch dare. What else can Roze think of hmm, LA, NYC, Houston, Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Richmond, Athens.
"now roze sees 6 figures.
Boy do you really know how to hit a face.
Parabolas.
Gaussian Equations.
Leibniz Notation && Scope.
Newton Realizations && Laws.
When was the last time.
Well it was just
a mere
as you get the idea && the general point
of the matter at hand.
Than roze begins to go to other places.
Only roze can go to these places.
Is that true roze?
This is the only thing that is true.
Roze is here.
When was the last time you left a place
to go to
another place?
Was it entirely && did it come
all of a sudden?
What exactly
Roze is
getting at
is this.
When able. Usually comes thru.
In all that is all.
When could you use it? U say it could be as early
as possibly this week?
Thas' good.
Roze hear from you later.
I would say so myself.
Better job done
than I could of done it myself."
Now what we have to offer here, in the most well known city of the Great Midwest. Is a variety of mechanical docks. 
That house a variety of goods && in relation to the Tri-cities && various other expensive suburban townships. Boating areas. 
Tourist attractions. You name it.
Sweet 'home 
@chicago
 where any type of business can be brought here, run here && commercialized. In this metro-billion dollar city that is only growing && has a population 
as Roze would believe to be 2.7 million people. Many neighborhoods of this city are more popular than others
You have the great train system running in out of here, the @Metra && @Amtrak. Alongside the bus system, @GreyhoundBus && the @cta buses. 
Which tailor to what is called, the 'L' which is short for, an elevated transit system, also run && marketed by the @cta && its takes $2.75
to ride that train && at that time you can ride each line. Which spreads across the entire city even going up to Evanston && covers the route to 
@fly2midway SE && @fly2ohare NW of chi-town. The blue line, the pink line, the green line, the orange line, the famous red line &&
yes even a yellow line, the purple line. Covering different spots. In these same neighborhoods you have a variety of bars && grills at your choosing 
&& a customer can even proceed to shop at their leisure. Whereinall you can then visit our wonderful, @NavyPier, to enjoy yourself
Where you will find another burgeoning, beautiful, mega, profitable, place-2-go, with a variety of sports teams

What could be other than giving it what is necessary. Does this Universe have any feeling? Roze means that his feelings gives him his emotions in this Regard. But how so. Roze believes through the actual pain that Roze can in fact experience. Either physical || emotional which is determined this Evil. So Roze feels better without this term around. Why is it that So. Roze has biked enough to figure that out && once in a great while you finally Lay Down. Once again beside us. To wake up again && Repeat it once more. Its almost as if this life is completely lawless. Certainly it is Roze so he has made a very good point. Very good point indeed. So I thought as well. Turns out it gets even better as Roze begins to fully realize his surroundings as, All is Well. At least.

A Branch of Philosophy.

Dont ya jus ‚ù§Ô∏è rollercoasters.
Especially Six Flags, Great America!
Where you can ride one
can Roze get motion-sickness on that 1.
Well thas' perfectly fine. But make sure.
You have a bite to eat that is, 'ready.'
Make sure you take a counterActive
motion sickness pill
|| just brace yourself.
Because it removes the fun, the sickness.
&& then sum' kind of mirror.
Where Roze today is at a loss
4 words.
&& then various construction crane ideas.
For the betterment of the entire human race.
Usually roze jus' types until the words run-out.
Like 'doze pills.
But sober is really good too.
The memory is more warm
However enjoying a variety of substances,
in moderation, is rather vivid as well.
Like that Gaspar No√© film.
As that is one of Roze's favourite directors,
now you know.
That was one of Roze's recommendations.
For he thoroughly enjoyed it && had a
once again,
an-out-of-body experience.
For that is what transcendentalism
truly is.
To remove yourself of the natural.
Begin the spiritual. Onsetting, Resting.
Existentialism. Whats the difference
these days thats up to you.
As Roze is asking alot of questions?
p's && q's, mind you.

You know what we had before these. Obviously made in the slave Quarters. We had daylight, candles, fires && torches. Do you believe that. Before. Now we have these strewn across everywhere we can in fact see. These have become a necessity of our very lives. To be known. We must have them everywhere if we do not we become animals in the darkness. To see clearly in luminosity. Thomas Alva Edison is rather well known for this invention && you know what it did. It made the community which is the public, Safer && also it allowed us to work around the clock, you see.

Dj Spanish Fly is one of the Premier Memphis rap acts out 'dare. He is the Godfather of this scene. He's been at it since the 80's it looks like. I really respect his level in this Regard. Private parties, gatherings, cookouts, house parties within reason, Weddings, small theaters && small bars. You have to 'book him. I will place the YouTube Music link below. I just took a listen to one his Albums entitled, "UNFINISHED BUSINESS." "Cement Shoes" is by far one of my favourite songs of All-Time, Roze's. Nasty Neckface.

A collection of past stories. Meaning that what you have here is to be conquered, understudied && used to put meaning to your ways && life. Further meaning, it is what we take on can now be put to use. For the good of all. However with every form of Light that is seen as benevolent. It gives room for the, 'forces of evil' that Only want to harm us, in any way possible && how so. For the ultimate mortality outcomes, pushed to the brink. This is a way to live your Life. Every period of enlightenment throughout 'History' is also the story of how, 'Evil' gets away with it && can properly && successfully deceive us. Further leading us to our demise. Which is the ultimate outcome.

Well
when it gets like this.
Congrats.
Pulled it off once again.
Did I now, Roze?
Who is exactly, speaking?
Your mouth, your lips, your very vocal cords?
Moving in accordance of syllables in a guttural
belly trac, I mean your trachea?
Thats what Roze means.
Well that could be an example.
But why fill your cheeks && lungs
with such questions.
That would be selfish.
&& a waste of yo' time.
&& who you like too && how you like eachother.
As well.
Wouldn't that be fair?
Roze loves fairs && old timey' places && countryTowns
&& get-togethers.
Especially block parties.
Where we get to jus' know who
lives in the neighborhood
&& exactly what they do.
However the specialty.
As they perform it on
a daily basis
becoming what they do.
In-fact.
It resonates in them && how they move around in the
community. üòä
Where everyone is filled with glee' && happiness.
But also remember you must have the sadness.
What would life be without it?
Well.
A petting zoo. I am afraid, a corn on the cob &&
one of those elephant ears please.
A ferris wheel ride it is then.
Ta-ta.

Couldn't believe it, couldn't of thought so otherwise. What Roze believes is this. When our imagery that we so desperately believe in to be true that can happen in only a 'figurative manner.' In only shared human emotions. When that moves us it gives birth to this proximity, this understanding which is our common. Further putting meaning behind our words, the Word. Which we have repeated once again && time && time again. As they say, "time will tell" && what it does is tell us this. That this world is ours && driven by our own desires && thus our collectively derived human outcomes then will factually take place && we will then together live our history as this mass, the human population. Which is our destiny although Common.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend?fbclid=IwAR2srK8-wp2JVtg9m-yVmpCXlZT2AyyC4NOpDjhPpMg8FhTin8BFIs_xyXY

Roze also believes that the human race has yet to define many things that we can see && are in fact perceiving as a man || women && then we put our human understanding behind it. Because we are an organism commonly living with other forms of organisms. As we continue to live with these very sources of nature around us. We have yet to Factor in how humans interact with another to get things done, psychologically && Roze believes that we desperately need to make these determinations. Because our lives hangs in the balance && from these very dialectal && human emotional circumstances. It can then become very dangerous at times. Morality issues are being discussed either directly || indirectly. Thus us Humans favor whats in them if they do not see the same characteristics in others they are then sadly, outkasted as non-believers in "the Way of Things." Further leading to vicious feuds && bitter vendettas.

It really does look good. The fashion. It makes me feel exuberant. Roze has never been able to afford any pieces done by Louis Vuitton. What this fashion does is make people feel more connected && it can also serve as a way to better connect with business professionals && it opens up your business opportunities as well. Roze has also heard that the women love it. To see a successful man dressed lavishly. Celebrate his worth && also in the process emboldening others in the community at the same time. As you can see Jaden Smith complete this process.

Another subject of a 'human thinking pattern' to better understand the nature around us. Is this human undertaking. The animals must live a full && long life in order to be made available for this practice. Then the animal's Life is celebrated. As this practice is still in use && one of the oldest. The most exotic animals of this world are endangered by brutal Poachers. As they are telling us through eye-to-eye visual memory communication jus' where these kriminals are. As these animals are widely regarded && sacred && have brung us many good things && these animals are completely defenseless. Roze knows that our forces of 'Good' lies in wait to protect these animals as they take this very seriously && we as a human race have successfully befriended these beautiful animals of our shared Mother Gaia where be both so shall Live, together as one.

What could it be? Another [Box Set]? O my osh' kosh b'gosh. You have to transverse the data && hyperlink interweb in order to find this. Well. All you in fact need is an Instagram then click one of Roze's recently done pieces(July 28). You can then find his Facebook profile, this one, which he has made completely public && you can, in fact, at your leisure take in a [box set] as you are doing now. Yes, hello name Roze. You interested && reading. Might be good 4 you in the long run || short run. Once we become 'apart.' Otherwise Roze has it clearly labeled on his GitHub profile under his repository entitled, "ExquisiteMan..HisBrand..IntellectualPropertynameRoze" where in the Readme.md there are links to this Facebook profile || Roze's at this time, temporarily restricted Twitter page. Although there are many [box sets] there that you can still, once again take in at your leisure if you must || jus' want to pass the time. As Roze has said.

It means that there is a collection of 'nodes' which are children of a parent company. Roze means that there is shells with encasings that are labeled different 'nomenclatures.' Roze also means that inside these digital architectures the user && supplier has the ability to store any form of data that you can possibly think of. Say for instance your Chase bank account. This information is stored in a [reference number#] which is your 'personal logFile' in order to identify you, the user. That these companies Servers where they store this information which they in fact own, can read it at any time. Then you are able to retrieve your data for your own use && Chase is able to display it for you their bank customer. Once again.

An example of one of the most widely used modern databases of sum' kind is the very well known && famous MongoDB. Because its lightweight. Which means if you have alot of 'dataSets' if you have alot of 'dataTraffic' if you have alot of 'users' using the service at the same time && all the time. Then this company, MongoDB that houses your databases on their servers in a variety of ways can complete the digital tasks. Online. With very little amount of processes. So you can run your applications fluently && efficiently across other companies services && architectures. For example Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud && The .NET Platform.

With a collection of sweat. What has lead up to this very fact? It could be that my body. The Human Body has accrued enough work to finally give me the animal response. That is, showing what happens after the fact when Roze decides to go for a very long bike ride || a Run || if Roze is walking with determination || if Roze gets to play a sport of 'sum kind. First what happens inside of his body it begins to warm up all of his organs. From performing exercise. Then once again. Roze must exasperate

//August 2//
To get rite to it. Minus the funny stuff && all of the 'fluff. To get down, once again to brass tacks. As Roze is diddle daddling. As we are only here both today as you && I both know full well that their are many others who view it. Who would like to take in a [box set]. So here today, here we are actually. Once again. As Roze will show you. In ancient history which is alot like today. After we collectively || must of been chosen singularly for what we have done, had these 'premonitions.' Together as one with our minds. Then the Body proceeds to wake up from its slumber, risen. Again as it previously has before. Although if it were to be natural causes you'll in fact never wake up again. That is why NAS says, "I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the Cousin of Death." That couldn't be more than true which is a form of Absolute truth. When it comes to the sciences && the harsh realities of human circumstances leading to tragedies. As you see before you. Completely helpless.

That is why we have these Visions that we cannot explain. Resting. Roze speaks of our resting minds where our bodies are no longer necessary && if it is. This becomes one of the most Hallucinogenic && Lucid practices of meditation that we cannot even begin to explain || possibly, 'nor get a grip on. Roze often forgets. As that part has become necessary for Roze to not have to think about what jus' happened. However Roze will proceed to take on what he has, hence learned in his sleep time. His own freedom && nothing can enter his mind from there. Its completely his own place which is his 'frame of mind' && noone else's. Now when it comes to nightmares, Roze believes that these are leftovers. As Roze lives && leads a good life && experiences his macabre exploration under his own will. Nothing bad happens to Roze. He is of the lamb.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream

Roze always finds it interestingly entrusting us with these termed ancient Greek "folklores." Roze is lead to believe when a piece of truth is labeled as such it is not && of fantasy. However the humbling, purposeful hybrid creature of the Horse && the Rooster leading to a greater form of humility. Where from this precipice of human thought. Roze can better lead his life && realize his entire surroundings. Roze asks you, what would the Rooster be good for && what could it best communicate with? Roze will ask you once more, what would the Horse be good for && what could it best communicate with? There you will find your own derived answer leading to a better understanding. Throughout the the entire world && with our religions we as humans have a history of forming a better relationship with the Animals around us that share this Mother Gaia.

Roze always enjoys going into one of the nearby Foot Locker's. Where you can find a pair of shoes from $80-140 dollars$ which is Roze's priceRange. Roze always seems to get, up to Speed. It hard to make his choice. Because its how you are seen. In this world you need the correct type of 'sneaks. Its like a whole 'nother world in 'dare. Mysterious. Who doesn't want a fresh pair of J's? Without the harm to dem' toes. You know that real good pair of 'dem High Tops tha' jus' form to your feets like a glove. Perhaps sum' sporting wear as well. As Roze aims to please.

Here you have today one of the most featured feasts upon the eyes. That you ever will see for the rest of your days. Well. Until you go to a Whole 'nother one && 1 after that. Because that will in fact prove that you love these. So take Roze away off to a far away place jus' so he can focus. Removed from the harsh realities from the outside world just for a couple seconds. This is actually when people are at ease, happy, generous && in the harmony of great whimsy. That is when Roze begins to get uneasy. Because often the most places that are innocent. Darkness comes && they have to shut it down. But don't worry it will open the next day. If you got one of those weekend passes. huh!?

When Roze has his head dripped in these stories. When he has his body && soul up in the clouds so to speak. It derives these feelings that the world I perceive isn't what I think it is. Roze must begin to study myths, fables, folklores && legends && burned which are banned texts. Roze believes that this is an actual perfect excuse, a devised coverup && an excellent way to hide our absolute truths. To label them as such && from there it is seen as this. Only a form of creativity which are fabrications of the human mind done by the Author. In order to create false Entities of 'readings' as seen before you. To draw your imaginations in this

Once more revisited the classic renowned one at a time. Which is seen as a piece of history because it is the first globally widely circulated comic strip that features a once in a time comic book character, Garfield. Roze knows the Kreators name well, its Jim Davis. One of the most recognized American names that can be possibly thought of. Roze is happy to say that the technology is in fact there. To have a pet your favourite as a Friend. Then pick what kind of friend that you want to have. As Roze got yelled at for reading a Garfield late into the night. Because he had to suffer through school early. He was turnin' the pages of his Garfield too loud. Because for the first couple of periods in skhool. Roze is half a wake && usually jus' nods off. Is that usual? Roze doesn't think so. But I'll tell you what Roze was always happy to see was the adventures that Garfield got to go on. Always a new one && always a different way to hang out with your Kat. At home.

Roze has here as you speak. A collection of dramatizations, characterchures, violent media, time spools, yanks, yourself truly, appenditures, musically inclined picture-scopes, kaleidoscopes, periscopes && Riff Raff who should be everywhere that you see && every single medium at least 24/7. What is fun to see is when sum' of these companies take it quite serious && it pays off. Roze means that spot when your in one of these things. You get to a calm relaxation spot in between the rides && its at a very good temp && your body gets to rest for a sec && take in the fumes all around you. It smells horrible && theirs garbage all around && it takes Roze completely out of his experience where Roze jus' wants to get up && walk out. No fun to be had no more no longer. Its very easy to get abducted. Perhaps roze saw one in real life one time. Then from there Roze didn't do it. Furthermore what Roze has for you today is all of his realized discoveries && all Roze is doing is taking the best of those minds from all of the Great Thinkers throughout all of our time. Then a performance happens as you can clearly see all of these, prototypes, can in fact be made. Together as one in our own way regardless regarding regards. Who else might please this ever so right now may I ask. This is all Roze can possibly think of to give you Today like I said of his possibles. Shaun, its only 1 drink that you all then share && we eat before || we bring our meals to the park. Sandwiches. The other amusement is way to expensive to eat, to ride, to go on, to play, to win, to drink, to hurry up, to hide, successful, when, Roze saw you there && didn't you jus' like that ride.

to believe && thats it!
Nothing else matters.
&& that is very much true.

Drugs have existed for thousand of years.

is to remove narcotics from the

Here it goes. I said I'll give it a shot. Here's goez nuthin'. I said what it was. Did I stay too long there? Should of been. There its going right now. What could of been? Didn't I see you there I said hello. When could it be time ur sayin? Whens the last time. Couldn't of been a truth nor kare. Couldn't of been had no kare like I said. All the time u said. This was when the last time was. Couldn't of been more wrong on that remark. Shouldn't you be doin' sumthin'. Thats all the heart ya got out there. When could you have it done? Trust me as always as you have been doin.' God damnit. Here it is in my hands today the [box set] although u see what its doin its gettin a job done && pulling off profit from the kalf. Thas all its doin Roze. Its done I said. Well thats good because it causes a good feelin' && then hopefully you begin your study earlier than jus' watchin' TV like sum potatoe && wash yourself in the luminaries with a really bright white-light. Because you have no way of cleaning your human mind of all the toxic poisons that could of have attached to it like glue. Roze is taking all the media in without a second thought && he knows its harming him so he has what he hopes is his emotional guards in his mind where the images begin their processes to live in Roze's natural mind which is his so he thinks.

This is used amongst everything that is Known(). It can be used in any situation that the humanMind can think of. To this day it is relatively well known already. Did Roze believe that this understanding has been in us to put a human understanding behind it thus understanding what this idea which is a 'human thought pattern.' What could be done to help us in this regard. Which is all ekstasises. In Totality until only the natural outcome has naturally come to its conclusion && then it has occurred to our human knowledge. Then it can be successfully organized && put in a place of storage. For all other purposes that it is needed for most likely in comparison to others in order to draw further conclusions. Then coming to an end of a Process. That can be run for the foreseeable amount of time with no stops because it is mechanical you see.

Does Roze believe in the laws of mathematical probability && how those could affect his Life. That is what Roze is mostly like thinkin' about in this Regard. As Roze only wants the best outcome for himself which is an organism that can take on physical pain quite easily && causes of death inside of his body as well from any outside sources Roze is currently under && uses on a daily basis && things of those common natures. Roze will always seem willing to take the day && time && effort for the common good that is Mule'ing sumthin' that would logically && factually is going to turn out better for them in the future. When it comes to the amount of crime done in the past upon Roze. Their is a price of irreversible damage && proceeding to have to live with it. Roze is getting a new body. Hes one of the ones that actually need it. So thats good only for himself && his bitches.

//August 5//
Today a dynamic. A different solution as always && a well said. Should be perhaps a clarification && even a bibliography because Roze could say ne'thing he wants. It doesn't even matter anymore && to take another look at it. As this has been done throughout our history. Where we discuss what is to be done && at the end we come up with other arguments when Roze how long has he lived in a society. The systems are designed to work for us && not in a constant state of despotism where there is no answer for us but once again the constant "Mule'ing" which goes && turns out for no one. There must be counteractive forces at play. That makes the toilsome into quite a needless task. Then there is so many tasks that they cannot possibly be completed within the alotted time frame. Which makes Roze feel completely helpless && when humans feel this way they perform a self-harm practice. One way is obvious, out in the open && the other ways are hidden. Roze has learned that what is hidden means that noone can speak about it && if one of the ones who dont know about it if they where to see this it would be un-explainable && a mystery to them. That is why we have these forms of thought && these real systems taking place in reality in conformity for us at our service. It is a loss for words. Here today as I explain three categories of thought && use them to my benefit && social need. To get labeled one way || 'nother is a way to remove the meaning of the words that took Roze's exercise to place in front of you. As Roze can clearly see his place in this world that he lives.

What a quandary this has become in recent years, then decades, then Roze assumes centuries, then you get into sacred text terms, then sum time with other animals, then the beginning darkness. So what do you have here today, Roze. Let me tell you its the real deal. What Roze has here is beyond belief in many other eyes you couldn't even begin to assume this is the place in the world. The place were people think about how to order the public && achieve the best life Roze so shall live. Is that what is determined proceeding on is their any questions shouldn't be because I have answered them all for you in a "Whitty" way. For you to decide if this is truly the 5-pack that is. Roze is referring to all of the moving parts && in one point of time meet up in certain way pertaining to the Totality of feelings && thoughts at hand. It is very confounding to Roze that none of the great minds ever refer to it as evil. For if they where to speak it. Not since Leibniz && Nietzsche says it in his book title. So that would remain the meandered up against the well said && done && privileged && korrupt && familial ties. There is nothing to be done about this. By design these practices are working in a strong manner. However if you were to utilize these systems in all of its facets. All of its avenues Roze comes to realize that it is one of the most powerful forms of human kind that Roze can possibly think of && at this time. Being we are docile. This turns out to be less advantageous when we take part, eat && live in this world that we have made good && well if you have the money in order to live it. Otherwise its a different form of life lived && once again thats on Roze. Roze should be very thankful for what he has && was able to live with so he kan move on wit his life && thats all for now. Then comes a period in Roze's life that comes affected by the past. Roze doesn't remember any of those times. So it becomes this shedding period that Roze has to take part in however it may be that he did not know this before. Encyclopaedia Britannica.

"Ohhh, what a jubilee this is.
Is it always commandeering.
This is master-slave mortality.
What does that mean.
Well if a person wasn't suitable for the good life
in the past, they were made into slaves.
However with, "Despotism."
This can be put into place && take place.
For it has, for it did. For all is well.
Roze jus assumed people were good, never thought
they had this in 'em. Nobody did.
&& it shares the same model, in Similarity.
What else would Roze, like to say.
Well its strictly off the cuff.
I really like where, œÄ is going.
Is it always so, hypocritical?
Well
why wouldn't it be.
When you have everything on the line, Roze.
When nothin' makes sense.
When your on your last bit of sense.
In every sense && all of the senses.
To a 'T'. Together.
Then make it. Do it. Live it. Succeed.
Follow it, followthrough. You know the way.
The Drill.
Its beautiful, everything that I see.
I cannot compare it to ne'thing else.
Quite frankly.
So here I stare, here I wait.
Once again, to repeat && doover once more.
To never see the light of day.
Again."

Hey, Roze. When it comes to your mind. I am going to ask a simple question do you ask yourself what exactly this has been famous && recognized to ask for? The question I am pertaining to is this. Roze do you cover all of the subjects of human thinking && what it exactly means to the rest of us && mathematically you in turn as well? Roze. It seems to Roze either way you go about your personal research which is Roze's own divine nature, necessity && one's own desire. Roze can pick up here && there 'sum worth of thought to put his own thinkin' behind it. Roze knows who the great thinkers are. So Roze thinks he has a good handle on it. Roze will continue to read the Authors that interest him so && in turn will most likely draw from this wealth of interest, grandiose design, tables, mantras, repetitions, mantles, crevices, crests, oasis, the moon && the sun, metaphysics, physiology, philosophy, psychic analysis, water-ways, recycling, fundamental compounds, doctor to patient relationships, PUMA && so on. To name a few. Encyclopaedia Britannica.

What could it possibly be? Another question about our possibles. Asking directly to us, the human population why sumthin' isn't there || factually isn't quite there as of yet. Then once again the human race must complete the needless task of "Mule'ing" these possibles && our set of goals that will leave us with this objective. When it shouldn't be this way in the first place, the problem at hand. If it is. We clearly have criminal activity in all veins which give life to our systems of power && control which is our own personal livelihoods. Roze doesn't know how else to put these dismal outcomes. They have achieved us but nothing && in the future what we have collectively come to understand is that this can be all said && done within 70-90 years time. This is all that we do as a human race after we are done "Mule'ing" the piece of our common purpose down the line. Then what it faces is ideological opposition which means oppression. Now is oppression legal. You be the judge. As Roze has no way of exterminating this from the face of the earth. If the earth && its systems didn't have criminal oppression. State the world as a Reality of that.

I feel really on point. I never feel sad wearing these. But with every shoe company && every pair of shoes that they make. The flare, the flash, the high points, the bold style, the fashion statement the excitement usually dissipates around the 5th-6th week. Then they jus' become a whole 'nother pair of shoes. But these. Roze remembers really good moments with a pair of the
https://us.puma.com/us/en

Roze has taken this term quite literally with no exception. Everything Roze knows of that is a system. Can be broken down into its, 'building blocks' || complicated enough to determine all of its outcomes. Roze will see what this can do || that can do if he were to apply say for example the scientific method upon every body of 'knowledge' that Roze forever shall see && if it where to come into his path, Roze's. What this does is reveal the 'inner latticework,' so to speak of a genuine whole, a mistaken confounded human thought through experiment. Where Roze would need to experience this in order to understand && put his human understanding then behind it so. Then from there Roze can determine the root causes of this effect. Then from his precipice of human thought. Roze can better determine his human instincts. Further leading Roze to his own Desire in a makeshift world.

"Conclusions.
Equality == greater times.
More business, more profits.

But all is that last is what is to come.

Truly.
I always wanted before I go, to leave my dent on it.
Roze Means.

I'm talkin' more than the G8.
Roze is talking about things that take precedence,
things that take more of an urgency to talk about.

What have we done.

What could perhaps be ever so there. When it gets like this what was your purpose before this excitement, Roze. What was your disposition && I mean your objection. Your personal stance on these subjects at hand. Did you find what you where looking for. What I mean is your Soul, did it find what its lookin' for? Thas' good because now it has an opportune time of clairvoyance. So anything can in fact be accomplished because every problem does indeed in fact have a solution. Right below it. Like mathematics. Simply put. We must realize our longevity, our common destiny && we must, desperately make mathematical conclusions together. As great thinkers that have proceeded us, you && Roze. They have laid out thesis's that they have turned into widely acclaimed written materials && renowned books that have put an end to wars. Here && now && in the present day. As our society has aged drastically with civility but at the same time very little ground, which Roze means our progress has been made. For the commutative collective, the gathering, prosperous, legendary good-hearted men, women && children that only wish to live in peace && solidarity forever so as long as we so shall live.

Roze is seeing the decomposition of another star, is it a dwarf? This star is in a whole 'nother galaxy which is in itself. In Totality. Here it is with a collection of planets && this star that is now dying, which takes a long time. Here on earth. This star represents its solar systems life resources no matter how small that system is compared to ours. Our galaxy, the milky way. Like our human sun which serves us many purposes although simple. Our other planets that are in our solar system don't matter && have what Roze has seen as no purpose. So simplify it down to the Sun dying. We haven't even bothered to harness its power as a human race || reach any conclusions. Only solar. Which is weak. This galaxy the star is in has come to a logical end point && you will no longer see && it will become sumthin' else entirely. As almost as if thats its purpose in the 'long run' && nobody minds. Nobody will care || remember the Star that had no purpose for us || the universe at large. In the big picture of things now. Like a piece of garbage, remember when people thought that was where we should put our next landfill. In space. So you just have a variety of remnants.

The best solutions is to teach the students how to effectively study. The answer is not more strict rules, code of conducts && dress codes. Its delivering a proper education to a Student who wants it. That means all opportunities are made available to the Student. Study will then become second nature. In order for you to graduate with your degrees. I have a G.E.D. I have an A.S. I also have a B.S. Only through perseverance did Roze succeed by going to class everyday && in fact reading the materials required at hand. Study. Focus. Read it once more.

One way || another we have to perform a 'reciprocal effect,' from the beneficial qualities that are various products of the causes that lead to these outcomes we use on a daily basis.

I have yet to hear in its entirety Travis Scott's "Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight" && "Rodeo (Expanded Edition)" && "Owl Pharaoh." Roze has heard the other three of his albums that is available on YouTube Music. He embodies a very 'deft look upon humanity. He is doing sumthin' very interesting with your favourite shoe companies, the Mike's && the Nike's. He is with, one of the most famous women upon planet Earth her name, Kylie Jenner who they now have a daughter && son together. They took some time off from eachother. Then they got back together. One of our most universal, globally successful Artists of our times. At this time. Whatever he touches turns to gold which makes him a very exciting business entrepreneur && another reason to watch him. He is gunna be in South America this coming November.

Well. Today you have one of the most rewarding [box set]'s that Roze can perhaps give to you yet. It is because this is his expertise && as has been as treated. Roze will cover 4 things, 2 tools && 1 band && discuss very popularly used programming languages && effectively ide's. Which stands for as this is very useful, integrated development environment. Roze means that you usually need 2-3 running programs to successfully build an application && all at once but once Roze gets the hang of it. It becomes easier to balance as with any discipline as this Roze full well knows. Ruby Programming Language. Encyclopaedia Britannica. Ipecac Recordings. GitHub. node.JS

With every machine Roze needs to setup a platform to build an application in its specific runtime environment because with every programming language && Ruby is a very popular one now. In order to complete the project the business partner needs you to do. So what you have here is another way to explain a View, Model, Controller. So here it goes. To Roze a Model is where everything is stored where Roze can receive the data for the client-side && where Roze can store data on the server && decide what to do with this data. A View is a variety of pieces of code in classes to display the application developed. The senior developers tell Roze what these pieces of code are && Roze then creates a new application by putting the pieces together in a different manner then the previous application Roze just built && the development team uses the same logical foundations. A Controller is the way Roze can send commands which are methods programmed into what can be effectively communicated between the client && server. Once you have these 3 different pieces of code which are termed classes if these are working together. Roze can successfully build the application with a team of developers. This is a very famous framework.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)?fbclid=IwAR2mVEPC3LnlOju1mf-nHkwo9Cae6OdMcihX6EuUcwyH6QwN8s_pLhAiZ7Q

Roze needs to learn the commands to successfully run this type of programming environment. At a certain point Roze can setup a server on his own PC, Mac || Linux. Roze finds it difficult to run any IDE on his Google Chromebook. Its become obvious to him that I shouldn't even bother wasting my time. As that is what a developer usually does is research how to use his programming tools during development && their is constant task work && quality assurance && testing which means running test cases of probable outcomes performed by the would be user in a client-side && server technology experience. This is how everything is made it follows these same processes online && any && all technology that Roze might interact with does to sum degree as well. So having said that. Roze would set up this runtime environment with Node.js && then from there Roze can communicate with a database of his choosing for example MySQL && retrieve && store data on a server. Roze would need to code a server-side codebase. Then with that codebase Roze will develop various Javascript classes eventually forming a client-side codebase that communicates with the server running its server-side codebase. With these two codebases && a runtime environment that is Node.js which can emulate a server on Roze's PC && communicating with Roze's client which can be programmed with either Netbeans || Xcode || Android Studio || Notepad++. Then Roze can proceed to test && display his developed application. To work on with repetition && develop the entire application that needs to be programmed for the chosen user base.

(the) Melvins have released sum records on Ipecac Recordings. Roze bought the "Nude With Boots" vinyl it came on this big && really Red record && Roze in turn was really pleased with that era of (the) Melvins. When they had Big Business. Roze has to constantly remove his 'Naivete' because its all about finally being fully aware so Roze can transverse through his life better. In turn having a good life that has a correct balance of what is known. This band is Rock as far as Roze is concerned. They are Legendary.

In similarity. What Roze has here is a selection of disciplines surrounding subject matters at hand. When Roze removes the complications he begins to see that all of these disciplines are quite factually similar. Once again in their approaches, determinations, scopes, validations, procedures, human understandings && in Totality. So what Roze has here today is an Abstract art piece, 2 categories of human thought && 1 company Roze will successfully market. Today. As the past lesson yesterday went well. This is the "Exquisite Man && His Brand Intellectual Property."

You see how it do. How it looks like us how it moves around with our attitudes && demeanors. Do you see it all the same. It is part of us as we eat it so often its almost as if that its full purpose entirely. The life expectancy is 5-10 years. Imagine that moving across the farm to be slaughtered. What sum companies do is this && it is very well known is that the company tortures the animals && have them serve as examples. Then the food is completely tarnished. Food companies have to even explain that they are not torturing the animals. However us the consumers have absolutely no guarantee its just a collection of predators, grilling, marinating, slow-cookin' our natural prey that we have deemed no longer need to live its full life && must continue on into the 'slaughter quarters.' Where he || she sees its past friends on hooks && gutted && stripped of all life that it had. It must continue unwillingly. How long have we lived alongside these fantastic creatures && what can they tell us. The
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken

What a collection of dots, what a collections of splices. What a collection of animals chosen to serve as experiments. Its almost as if we invented this medical science in order to torture various animals that cannot protect themselves. Don't worry all animals are near their end of their naturally lived lives. No exception. Except that we are looking at this discipline of how it came to be. Where else can this discipline, Roze is saying, can we apply it elsewhere to great effect. Even the human thought patterns behind this can be put to good use in some place else. Using our dialect && our surgical tools && our scientific study enhancement technological techniques && our digital maps && our colleagues that work with us. Further building with our teams what we have jus' diagnosed further coming to an understanding about the building blocks of humanity. When it has been scientifically proven that once you simplify down to the smallest possible building blocks there is nothing else, like quarks. This is a very exciting science of the future.

A local circulation. Of the most dire needs of the public at large && their is stories that describe how to setup a wifi connection && their are stories to where to spend your money that you make working countless hours on the grind. The periodicals make various changes that cater to special interest groups. It has come rather plainly obvious that you as an individual need to fit a very specific "mold" otherwise don't bother trying to bring your ingenuity && ideas to the national public. We could perhaps stand better && most of all in a better, cohesive knowledgeable predicament. Their is constant victimization all over the place. Whenever they report grisly crimes they always forget to report the, 'pre-meditated grotesque occurrences,' that lead to these horrific crimes. Stripping the victims of their family members feelings. Sensationalizing everything that is macabre. No end in sight in finding all the sources of senseless death && violence. Because the reason is that sells these things. These companies that run them, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, USA TODAY, The Washington Post Magazine, The Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune have a preoccupation to safeguard the human race from dire life outcomes. What they have been proven to be good for is this. Do not look here, look sum'where else for your answers. We have already succumbed to, "Absolute power && Control," so their needs to be a move past this bias. As that is always the answer. What else would a person turn to for one of these for. Those business groups that run these also clearly take what they want to run as propaganda. As Roze can see their is a history of this 'obliviousness' further endangering the innocent public.

"Once again.

Roze had a good idea that will become a 'rotunda' around the tech scene. Any idea that Roze so shall have. Is reported quickly before he has it by advantageous consultants that are not seen as thieves || when he is formulating to draw his conclusions an idea of his is taken from him before he can bring this ingenuity to a company to work for. Of what would be nice to have.

I think the arcade scene as whole would be a great way to show a, "1-of-a-kind" && unique game, Microsoft Azure PlayFab. Although I know you don't have that type of 'big business' like other game studios to pull it off. Transformers && Top Gun are showing off these games that you can only play at certain arcades. Remember to bring at least 200 dollars a piece. So you can forget the outside world for a couple of seconds. I think that the arcades are only getting stronger. I'm poor, I can't afford it but if I could I would at least 2wice a year. People seek out these places that house these machines && what can happen is quite the gaming experience. That is why this company is still going strong. The food looks alright && the happy hour with drinks can be seen as expensive. Here is all the locations:
