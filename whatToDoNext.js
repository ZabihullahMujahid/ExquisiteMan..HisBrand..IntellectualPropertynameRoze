This one can be about chemistry:
Especially the history of Chemistry:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemistry
Then get into one the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, 
and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method.

As it did come into discovery in the 1600s
Which in even earlier times chemistry was associated with mysticism && alchemy which for 
even any subject that deals with these very subjects, it would entail more demonstrative powers of the laws of nature && ours.

This could be sumthin' new.
But as I remember
how
it
was
before.
These men were already
outcasted
by the
good
innocent
&& very pleasing
no matter
the caliber
women
by
us.
The poor men of good
who faced
ridiculous
amounts
of sexual deprivation
but that
was over
half a decade ago
already
&& all they had was money
so it was very easy to
rape a person
What I mean to say is
All the women
are safe
For good.
Thanks to be
Allah.
For that.
As well.
We have a good reminder
of all those nasty
recurring dreams.
Where they hook onto us
with no
solution.
Look no further.
There.
I had it once.
Now I am famous.

It could also be about fault lines. Which has to do with geology.

A godess, Aphrodite: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite
why does history always have a pecuilar way of decribing these
Goddesses. An ancient Greek Goddess. Greek mythology. Hinduism. Buddhism. Aztec mythology.
Maya mythology. Roze begins to see the similarity but at the same time, peoples, defined it
in other words than other peoples on the different side of the world. With different advantages.

When You Just
Dont Care
&& You Shake It All About
&& You do a song called, "Hokey Pokey"
&& You realize what they have done to your body
&& That its full game.
You have nothing to guard it.
You cannot afford a guard system.
This is poor town && you live in it.
So be it. As it has been said.
Is it because you have no choice in the matter?
Is that why your question is filled like Air in your body?
Does it matter what I do with the answer?
Thas' good. Well that was alot of fun.
As they say.
Cheerio is another but I would like to see you try?
Would any good man make it all this way so far?
You could say that.
Thanks. I said
Goodbye.
To-la lou?
Have a good time. I'll be back here when you see me.
Meet me at home.
Alright.
What does that mean.
It means what you think it means.
Then its my next favourite thing O My God.
When it came to this, what did you do?
Well I had it once. Then tried another time.
When could I come over you say?
When was the last time?
Why couldnt it of happened this way?
C-Ya Later.

Reppin' @CHANEL && @maybelline because this is what the female needs && thinks about.
Then begin to talk about the skincare && always looking good for the outside world mostly.
Girls spend most of their time making themselves up for others. Then mostly their man. 
I guess you could say. Their just like everybody else.
