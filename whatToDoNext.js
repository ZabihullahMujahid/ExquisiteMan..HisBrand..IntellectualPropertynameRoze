This one can be about chemistry:
Especially the history of Chemistry:

As it did come into discovery in the 1600s
Which in even earlier times chemistry was associated with mysticism && alchemy which for 
even any subject that deals with these very subjects, it would entail more demonstrative powers of the laws of nature && ours.

This could be sumthin' new.
But as I remember
how
it
was
before.
These men were already
outcasted
by the
good
innocent
&& very pleasing
no matter
the caliber
women
by
us.
The poor men of good
who faced
ridiculous
amounts
of sexual deprivation
but that
was over
half a decade ago
already
&& all they had was money
so it was very easy to
rape a person
What I mean to say is
All the women
are safe
For good.
Thanks to be
Allah.
For that.
As well.
We have a good reminder
of all those nasty
recurring dreams.
Where they hook onto us
with no
solution.
Look no further.
There.
I had it once.
Now I am famous.

It could also be about fault lines. Which has to do with geology.
