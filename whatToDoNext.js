This one can be about chemistry:
Especially the history of Chemistry:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemistry
Then get into one the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, 
and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle
As it did come into discovery in the 1600s
Which in even earlier times chemistry was associated with mysticism && alchemy which for 
even any subject that deals with these very subjects, it would entail more demonstrative powers of the laws of nature && ours.

This could be sumthin' new.
But as I remember
how
it
was
before.
These men were already
outcasted
by the
good
innocent
&& very pleasing
no matter
the caliber
women
by
us.
The poor men of good
who faced
ridiculous
amounts
of sexual deprivation
but that
was over
half a decade ago
already
&& all they had was money
so it was very easy to
rape a person
What I mean to say is
All the women
are safe
For good.
Thanks to be
Allah.
For that.
As well.
We have a good reminder
of all those nasty
recurring dreams.
Where they hook onto us
with no
solution.
Look no further.
There.
I had it once.
Now I am famous.

It could also be about fault lines. Which has to do with geology.

A godess, Aphrodite: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite
why does history always have a pecuilar way of decribing these
Goddesses. An ancient Greek Goddess. Greek mythology. Hinduism. Buddhism. Aztec mythology.
Maya mythology. Roze begins to see the similarity but at the same time, peoples, defined it
in other words than other peoples on the different side of the world. With different advantages.

When You Just
Dont Care
&& You Shake It All About
&& You do a song called, "Hokey Pokey"
&& You realize what they have done to your body
&& That its full game.
You have nothing to guard it.
You cannot afford a guard system.
This is poor town && you live in it.
So be it. As it has been said.
Is it because you have no choice in the matter?
Is that why your question is filled like Air in your body?
Does it matter what I do with the answer?
Thas' good. Well that was alot of fun.
As they say.
Cheerio is another but I would like to see you try?
Would any good man make it all this way so far?
You could say that.
Thanks. I said
Goodbye.
To-la lou?
Have a good time. I'll be back here when you see me.
Meet me at home.
Alright.
What does that mean.
It means what you think it means.
Then its my next favourite thing O My God.
When it came to this, what did you do?
Well I had it once. Then tried another time.
When could I come over you say?
When was the last time?
Why couldnt it of happened this way?
C-Ya Later.

Reppin' @CHANEL && @maybelline because this is what the female needs && thinks about.
Then begin to talk about the skincare && always looking good for the outside world mostly.
Girls spend most of their time making themselves up for others. Then mostly their man. 
I guess you could say. Their just like everybody else.

Here you get the entertainment expos where
Dave && Busters
FTW Chicago
HiPoint
Headquarters Beercade
Getting into ROMs lately.
Why are they so big? Where they really popular && still kind of are very popular.
Why does the fandom have its ups && downs?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game

Here comes the heart of the matter.
O' no! what does that mean.
Did you always wanna be a poet
Idk.
I heard it was ok its another way to entice
the women around me that are being held from me
so that means I cannot live the life
that I want.
Homeless.
Job with a place living with these very criminals?
Living at your sexual slave home? Face Down?
Its really only these
three
options.
Then
the
continued
waiting
as you dont want to
gnaw
at the wound
all of the
time.
That would be pessimistic.
However
you would like to be opportunistic.
But what would
that then
make the rest of the world.
That would make
the world into one big pot of gold
like a
bowl of
@luckycharms.
Then with a piece of bread
in your
favourite
toppin'
so it would go all
nice.
Then you would proceed to satisfy your
bowels && just say
to yourself
that you have rewarded yourself for a hard days
work && this is perfectly nutritious && good enough to get you to that next meal.
Where you will find the remnants of that
very
bowl
of
cereal.
You once had.
Then your again
eating another lunch && that will save time
until Dinner.
Where everybody gathers 'round
&& gets fat.
Until the tusk of salt is in
each leg
roze's belly && hips
shoulders && chest
guts && hearts && heads
then arms.
So Roze requires a salt
at all times
when roze eats
any kind of sandwich.
To this day.

Then just what kind of beer do you wanna drink during your play time. What prizes can you win.

//May 31//
Now looking at this piece today, roze fell into two different areas. One being, the beginning of time itself. 
The other the next urgent question of artificial intelligence. Like jellyfish. You must read Schopenhauer, Jung of 
course && Adler is big, roze. Entitled, "Chicken."

What a young science this is. With an off-beat name. Roze has never liked it but just think of it as, 'scope'. 
Begin to look at all of the exciting fields the Biological sense entails. Do we understand our minds && how they are 
made? Than we must have
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology

To think that we needed ingenuity, survival of the fittest, natural selection, human necessity && one other thing. 
Roze has a gun pointed at his Johnson. Most of all, the age this took place, the 'Late Stone Age,' where alot went on. 
Just how did we evolve
