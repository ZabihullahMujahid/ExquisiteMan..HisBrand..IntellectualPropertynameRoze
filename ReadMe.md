For I modeled this after all of the People Nation, music property Heroes && Insignias.
To further education, spark interest, drive profits in business.
It is a entrepreneurial business concept.
Where I am currently using my art, Abstract. My fashion sense, from my music && finally my
Poetry to better describe my feelings && emotions. Its also a personality of sorts && author
What this does is make an intellectual into an artist. Promoting only good throughout the
community, amongst fellow artists && the like.
To help business,
create business && then
finally completing business
&& showcasing business && speaking about businesses on Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, NEIU, CCC.

iNTELLECTUAL PROPERTY HERO and iNSiGNiA
Exquisite Man && His Brand Intellectual Property: name roze(Ben Zariatnatmik)aka THE OMNiPOTENT OWL â™¾ðŸ¦‰

The concept is as follows.

* 2 Intellectual Property Heroes && Insignias in a room thinking outside the box.
For an educational podcast about what drives excitement around or infomerriational
Could be about your 'local && corporate businesses && conglomerates && friendly personnel.'
You have your makeshift tasks && each Hero has their own speak sheets.
You cover what you need to say about business && complete business && that means you have informed the 
listeners various things they need to know.
Then I && the other hero will discuss what is happening in the
community in terms of 'entertainment, eating, housing || auto'
Then get into what you like either music || sport || dining.
I bring up the business I've been working on. The other insignia shows you their business.
You exchange like I said, talking points.
Discuss the fields of thought && see if I can further education.
Put your artwork up there.
Then share artwork && thoughts about todays business && anything business that businesses would like to be spoken.
The concept is here.
A man || women, an idea, networth && ideas && talking points.
The business, any startup && business offerings && all sponsorships.
Then mostly likely of all || any starpower do you have it && got it. Hold on to it.

* Concerning this business entrepreneurial concept.
If you succeed in your Art then your going places.
If your Art passes a significant bar.
As you can tell with mine.
Then Roze will succeed in business && as an intellectual.
This needs to be a 20-30 @YouTube with another insignia.
Then your really bangin' on all cylinders.
Roze brings his applications in development to show.
Roze has his sponsorships && his business partners.
Roze begins to advertise, market, promote that business.
Roze talks about interesting thoughts with the other insignia.
Roze ties this into either his abstract art || fashion design.
The other insignia takes its turn.
Roze trades thoughts about what is at hand.
Roze talks about local opportunities, wine && dine, news.
Roze wraps it up into a 20-30 min package.
The viewer has many things to go over.

* So you have an entrepreneur with his choice of art to share, there is various businesses && projects he is working on, 
he can forward exploratory education, he can market anything on topic, complete business, talk about the business community, 
schedule business deals, promote.

* Now let us bring in further detail. As I am the ((CEO)) making me the person best suited to protect each and every
intellectual property hero and insignia and their very own intellectual property along with all of the monetary gain
that these heroes are owed along with incentive these are very exciting business entrepreneurs and you will continue,
as an audience, see these insignia's in the medium I have at my dispose**(*-_>.Barack'Obama'PUT_(0>In'-_:-;PLACEE::9v;
Now we have two different avenues, the musical property hero and insignia's have already taken on a different note 
because of this intellectual property hero and insignia scene and this is a good thing. However we can face, theft 
and criminal activity resulting from this and if said'so is in fact a criminal. That aside. Its illuminating local
business entrepreneurs already and you know what this means? Safety and good business but battling bad business with 
criminal business oppression. Again, that that aside. Lets move on to the development of every insignia and in comparison
of the other successful insignia's. Now you have a route to be a professional Artist or a very, in your own right,
successful business entrepreneur leading to your own company ownership--where you can play the economy in an economic
comfort and  you will always have this ""8/9ewMedium"0-)/0ew:-;at  your leisure. Because that is what business is, for I
am perfectly qualified with my Associates in Science from CCC, "Harold Washington" and my Bachelors of Science in Computer
Science from my alma mater Northeastern Illinois University"""@/?'fter CCC':0:-;f:')"-'/?""'m?:-;e<,W.>M /?@HW_College
thats right Harold Washington Junior College where you get a choice from an Associates in Art or a Science. So you let
your degrees speak for itself. Now everyone is excited to see this out in the music venues, the music festivals and the
dance clubs. That is a whole different demographic and experience. As the Savoir of Mankind, I am a big name so I can go
further. To have it develop into a similar scene like the Musical Property Heroes and iNSiGNiA's has yet to be seen in 
fact there hasn't been one started by the thieves. Anywhere its good for good, evil makes it harder to accomplish or get
done. You find that time and time again, this quality of human oppression and like I have said bad business leading to
no business accomplishments. I envision a perfect world of the intellectual property hero and insignia, the educational 
property hero and insignia, the sports hero property hero and insignia and the musical property hero and insignia. What 
this business entreprenuerial concept does is make $$$BUSINESS LIVE$$$.>:-;|>.Which is good for everyone because everyone
is thinking about their business prowess and how much coin they did have and do have to throw around and use their own
countries economy to their best and own personal extent. Pertaining to this counter balances between each kind of property
heroes. You will see that this can fully work inside of the business world and in any field of professionalism and the 
difference between that and performing live like a musical property hero and insignia becomes more clear. What I have
been successful is promoting these music property heroes and insignia's and in result have come more afloat in the U.S.
economy and from this position it spells very bad to the criminals that use "bad business" as a significant utensil for
the black hand. It is meant to bring into light the "/"Oppression"\" and bring criminals to justification then their exit;0exz:
The eexploratory education side means that the intellectual property hero and insignia can use their sources to not only my 
benefit but also the audiences. Leaving the audience smarter than before, because that is what human knowledge does. Once
inside the business world you will see that it can become sort of a glossary, appendix even a table of contents to the
business partners that treat us well and operate good business with our other participating business partners and advocates.
Once various steps of these lists of processes is done, business business Business and more Business to all and each insignia.
So this is a very good sign, as it will take a while to develop this into a scene as the Music Property Hero and Insignia scene
once started in its infancy, now it is quite a money-making-machine, a gold mine, a global traveling agency and 
artist ownership:|> So I believe it will get their and we can develop it based off of city and state and now even each Country.
Then we showcase Art, I have Abstract art or my fashion to show to the audience also my take on the "Poet" is, starting off good,
because I am William Shakespeare reincarnated. The art can speak for itself and also bring the audience into an educational moment,
perhaps a business partner completing business with another or multiple, or the advertising and of course the marketing of a
necessity-commodity-business outlook-you-name-it. I have started a business and research angle which would lead to further good 
business with a select company that needs this type of research done and then properly capitalized and further incentive always follows
with that good company for I am a good businessman and did good business with them. So as you can see, Hero's, are unearthing in an
archealogical manner many good things for themselves and our company and they can move on to other things if they so choose. This is deemed
their economical sole proprietorship and as always true incentives will follow and future prosperous business always does. Getting back,
to the community that we do shall want to help in any way that we can as it is stricken with poverty, gun crime, physical grave violence 
and criminal activity operated by law enforcement, gang-cartel-mob members, political officials, business professionals and anyone else that
identifies with the fact a human body is worth more in Coin than the love that it can hold for another, to quote Dumas. As it is also
said in their, some have a quill behind their ears and an inkpot for a heart but this would just make you more of an efficient business
professional. So their is many economic devices operated by criminals that we will face as we embark to make this as successful as we
possibly can capitalizing on everything we possibly possibly can and will, do. We need everyone to get a GED(to graduate High SchoolK-12),
then an Associates from a NON-PROFIT Junior College and then from there its usually a Bachelors a Masters a Doctorate. That would be
our Educational Goal:::Our business goal, would be this:::Our business entrepreneur goal, would be like so and we can all along
develop into a better Artist, individually:|>><T>.s>F:#; .>#/?'

* I have successfully migrated all of my twitter Data && now have salvaged my Twitter account completely, date generated: May 12, 2022
* What this is, is an interactive HTML.
* Where I can see all of my abstrack artwork && my fashion showcases which I do not. I repeat do not want them to be stolen.
* I can see all of my tweets which I started since mid' January.
* Now in order to get all of my tweets in a text document that remains to be seen. I have yet to see where this html pulls my tweets from, 
  looks like a javascript. The images are saved in the folder, 'tweet_media'
* Sum of the images did not copy over correctly. Its interesting how it started as 1.1 GB however I chopped this baby down to 49.7 MB's.
  You know why its because it includes all of the worlds countries emojis && a giant list of other ambiguous icons.
* just uploaded more of the images saved with the correct 'taglines.' 'correct image filename calls' A couple of them are still missing. Most, 89.48% is there.
* This archive does not show my threads I have written, nor my replies && I mean to say when I get into areas. My wikipedias neither. This is of concern.
* The tweets are stored in data/tweet.js grabs them from a very long json. No way to log each individual tweets into a book of sorts at this time. 
Further getting into it, the individual tweet 'Replies, the threads' are under the Replies [Tab] so it isnt a total loss, my tweets are there. 
But still I would like for it to be clearly && cleanly organized as the real-time web application. This separates my threads however when I use Twitter it does not. 
Why this is. Is a problem. This is still considered a bug.
* They have now restricted my twitter account && I just tried to create a new one && I had to go thru the same verification process. I dont have a phone #! I am homeless && peniless. 
I'm guessin this will last for about 14-20 days until Twitter proceeds to give mercy && you can logIn again. 
* Luckily I saved everything just in the 'knick of time.
* If your looking to make yourself into 1, an Intellectual Property Hero && Insignia than you only need to jump from ['tab to tab'] && follow the same dates.
* Because my twitter account has become temporarily restricted at this time because Twitter does not know if I am a robot || a person.
