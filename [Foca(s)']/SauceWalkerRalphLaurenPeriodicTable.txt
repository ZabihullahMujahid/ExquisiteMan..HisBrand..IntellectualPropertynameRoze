I think he is bringing a "New York Style"" out of Houston, Texas. where he is from and birthed.
Houston has a big name in rap.

Imahopskipandthenajumpathim'The thing about havin'beef is that their is this otherside to the beef. Now I don't have any beef 
with anyone. Roze aside. Its meant to bring out your true colour and create room for other beasts and creatures and big men
that want only one thing, glory and space. Artectual space. Artistry. Now that their is a beef its set for life, and he just
made a freestyle to one of his songs from one of his latest. Where does the critique draw water and where does it not "hold
any water," the conquest leading to glory is perfection. It can be done, we have seen it take place. The rap game is also
about various work-ethics. You can lay your success on that. Its also based off of talent level. Concert going has changed
these days your either in the "box" or at the Arena'ss. So who were to judge for success? Success-making. I know I am 
excited for next 'Extend Play' his dis(c) and retributive (Coll)ective. I'm gonna' spin it like I did 'Dat Boy Den' and I will
recieve the better nostril of protection, of the HumanKind, and the significant flavour coming from his hometown, Houston. 

I think the biggest'thing is that you look presentable and accustommed/:eO0')""-:-;?///(m)cmmc>M.os:-;?"-'?/'
Yet at your leisure, but this is very serious a business man or woman ready or have grown accustommed to the fact
that your someone to count-on. Varying types of professional-like business attire and yet at the same time, when your
feeling rugal. Which means your ready to talk pelican or are going to talk in pelican. And then usually this follows with'it
and that.
