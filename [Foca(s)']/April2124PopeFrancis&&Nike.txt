How much gravity it takes and what he has done to his papracy in accordance of the will of God.
God in every man, woman and child regradless of its sexual makeup of its sexual reproductive organs and what it means to get be married.
Its a big step and needs to reogranize the Vatican. Almost as if history already has written this; part.
Every catholic agrees, every catholic can see it. I mean every single church giver and church atendee can see these are two followers.
Just like everyone else, that is a follower of the Catholic Church.
The extent of his power in this world as a symbol as an oligarch as an avid church-goer.
The displays of the'the kissing of the feet to the prisoners, now proven and have been and always will be iNNOCENT;
His Mob ties, his cartel ties and his gang ties. His procession of law enforcement beit' Secret Service and the police even the Vatican Police;
His constant calls for peace, this is how life goes' and his remaning remarks of dialogue between peace'figures during WAR'TIME
What he embodies in accordance with the Church;
His own personal held and stricken beliefs with and in tandem not necessarily in comparison but alongside the beliefs of the Church and that isasa'whole regarding the differences held individually and those beliefs in-stated within the confines of Hold God's walls and the Holy Trinity and the remaning remarks and suchas'
If of the cloth, you are of the sheep, then you must smell like a sheep. For I embodied that quote of his that he still uses to this very day and it has changed my life. To me its one with everyone that can share human experience albiet the ones who suffer and those who aren't suffering at this time. All shapes leading to the colours of the cloth representing the resounding participation and demonstration of the Human Body, that is catholic regarding any and all religion held within, "the Peoples" held'held often in similarity but also the stark differences that draw us to the utensil.
Spirituality and the time-folding upon us and holding our loved-ones closeby and together as one as we journey to natural causes.||""-_huft"/'_:-;"-_?/'+'2?/='
It is one of the most popular religions and for good reason and again in comparison but never in comparison you must understand this is the held cloth of the youth that will.
The history of the Vatican and how he likes to room, stay and live and bread in the "Guest Quarters" for his frugal nature he has seen it as necessary, 87, and will continue to have these ""hardships"" but this is only due toil. To remove himself from these unnecessary moments and remind himself, often, but a sheep of the sheep. 
How church donation means food on the table and how these donations give to other churches representing the Catholic Faith
Catholic Christian Lutheran and how these branches of the Catholic Church represent the Catholic Church.>Different forms of the Catholic Church in totality.

Claustrophobic is more like it.
When I stand.
I don't like to when

said.

But you have been meaning to get to that point;
And the point then was.
As you been meaning to get to that once again.
I didn't say thy.

But but you did say
Thy
But, butt
Was it
Not like that.

Sayin' your an "Ass Man""
Meaning you don't like a pair of tits.

No I do.
Then why didn't you just say that instead then.
As you continue
Continue to
Wrestle with one thyself oneself thy only self.

All that is here.

But what is the remedy.
Then the good point about it was.

Then the clutter'point right back at you.
Back at was at.
