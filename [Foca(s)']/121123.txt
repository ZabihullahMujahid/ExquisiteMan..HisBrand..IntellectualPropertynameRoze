And on and on you can see this as the true painting his life driven to lunacy even with these type of forces working against you[]'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh
and these same protrusions, intrusions and law-breakers with familial ties in order to get away with it. What you have is the common story of predator and prey and in this world of ours with these utensils at a criminals disposal you have type of outcome viable. His surviving works are difficult to look at. Now that he is in the past to 37. Meaning he lived a very short life and was the greatest painter of his time and continues to be regraded as the greatest painter the world has ever seen and was in poverty the entire time he did not get to live a good life like others that were more monetary successful and he a lone painter. He lived in the late 19th century as you can see and continues to be the greates of all the great painters that was ever was. The reason for that being is no other than human survival as we are all victims to some degree or another, factually. So you have the victims, over here and on this side. Which we the viewer are treated to his works and in of this modern era leading us to the depiction of a man, hunted and living in squalor nothing to have of your own and have to make due get by and more often than not you eventually power through the necessary ways to survive and eat then sleep this is what you must do as the century was a turning point in the industrial revolution and we all started living in the future of what should be and not the reality leading to the future of what we have done in the past. As often men of "Great Thinkers," if a man where to be of a "Great <,m.>ind" then it would create light where their is darkness and feed the mouths of others products of human suffering and there you would find Van Gogh. Leading us to the way of a form of great Art. Art so great it has yet to see its limitations in the world we call life, with it. His work yet to be seen across many age-groups and to those that have an appreciation for art and those who live with art and to to those who create Art like its some form other than belonging to them at the present time and that is what we have come to be known and then like I have said before we human understand and it is good for our minds to achieve this plymouth and from this point on we can continue to express art and move it around to our liking when it gets tougher and tougher to make it past the murderers, rapists and thieves..

Here me out and all:;"'?/
And all in lover lane?:;"'
So that would be the way:
Don't you mean the market?

Now I am not one to tout\
There it would be ever so plain"':;?/
Then need for it was before,
the time
was
the ever need for it was ever'so plain once again!

And I needed it now,
more than I needed thou now and
And
You Get to Grow Bigger
and soon your with the higher ups

But what is this now
This now,
This and that now and once it was now
It was then the now:
And so it got cold outside
And now I said its cold outside and there is a need for more heat outside::

There wasn't anything no need for that:
I said
did you not hear me,
stand,
I said once more.
Stand in solidarity of any form of self-defense::

I stick to the burgers and sausage. I don't often venture out and when I do its off into another form of burger or like I said sausage patty. I don't have much to talk about anything else either. I usually am pretty darn satisfied. For anything or everything when I stare, once again at the menu the Clown has made. So anywhere from the in between to when you want a dog vomit or to have it smell like a dirty baby diaper or have all of the food stay exactly the same making meaning taste the same and the bathrooms are for everyone to use for anything at all that you can set your mind to after you buy anything you would like second hand and remember that the dining room is closed 10pm sharp every night no matter the day. The breakfast budgets just got tighter the 2 for 2$ just got upgraded to a 2 for 3$$ but when the rich buy everything for everyone because your making the rich some more of their rich money then it becomes an expense even for the rich. Like I said, the place is usually kept up and its nice inside if you are staying for a meal and a drink. The focus is usually put on where you need to sit. The workers can take your food to you and they will be with you ever'so shortly because your food just came out and you paid for it that is why you are receiving "it and don't let anyone say that you can hang your hat up and with less then 20 dollars. An order you want is now had by no other than you. The guest to the Clown. The Clown dresses you up in fries and your choice of drink, usually your Go-2o. Your then taken away to that American taste of a burger and fries or a sausage and a hash brown depending on what time of day that itis'. Like I said could be mourning or then the late-night when you need a snack from the Clown. You then complete your visit upon Exit. No problems. Let me see you in the mix. Let me see you order your favourite, "Value Meal" and make sure you get whats whatgg[][]' The clown is one of the most advertisable property owners that I have ever seen an LLC use and our local LLC has to be up for a random chaotic violent exchange and at that time only the pig-a-roos are right and everyone gets a wound and leaves in a very un-safe kind of way after everyone will recieve what they is due. An all. You never know by anybody to complain or say anything to nobody and then somebody would assist you if you the would need help purchasing even sitting down where the clown has left red yellow orange bar stools brown booths what have you in the setting for all of the persons to see you if you needed to be seen you can even watch the latest served by the Clown because all day long and every 5min or so the Clown has a guest in the Drive-thru and you know what happens there, the Clown gives you a bag and its full of all your warm smucks https://mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/full-menu/burgers.html
