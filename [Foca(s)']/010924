I think his spirit speaks volumes. Considerabley, one of the many reasons if not one of the only reasons human divinity is possible. Human divinity meaning sacrilegious--./='Sacrilegious meaning you place your brothers and sisters
before you. You hold the public body in this way. In such a way that strangers are no longer emotionally distanced but close to one another. To each one of us, in these several cases otherwise your out on your own achieving your
own solidarity and tranquility practices that you hold with your very own family. And each one, has importance. To us and then that. That being what is termed, ""Good"" for all is usually always and has been good for the rest of us,
living beside you. Sharing these same human experiences:09::-;<,.>M LIOP;/?'So you can go on to speak about how we rely on his church and his sermons. He often was the only thing holding us all together. 
Father Pfleger is what holds us all together. We all have experienced some form of great loss, even tragedy. We are all victims to some degree, and to those left unscathed you are missing out on anything and that and
this is very Real. Something is lost. Nothing is gained and, "you get the Picture," from there and one of his sermons where he is in common'Dress wearing the cloth as always as the Man of the Cloth he can be seen like
every other Father every Sunday and this takes us through great darkness and horror and leads us to our own perseverance even with our great loss, these family members lost in the most brutal and horrific ways. Ghastly. 
So theres that. I am pleased to see him at his march in the loop of @chicago and one of his services, where he brings out the dancers and words are sung. Prayers are shared this is one of the most successful worships in all of
Chicagoland and the Father lives right inside of the same neighborhoods that are covered with dead children. For substances now un-prohibited just like alcohol was and marijuana is now legal in 24 U.S. states.
So this is tied-into-everything-that-there-is'PP. Just like his spirit is with the rest of us'*therestofUs' and he keeps speaking about loss. Those family members of ours are long gone. Never coming back he also gives us the life
lessons the bible has so we can continue to pursue more light rather darkness in our hearts. The darkness, that we are all in touch with is only natural. That darkness is only their for the necessity of survival then the vengeance 
achieved and then with it,-always comes the retribution for the victims and their families left alive. Thank you for the well being and mind, Father#089. He has been good to us and this city, is his to love.

So I could have the clearance, the remedy certain. The time of day, that time of day where I do my own personal check-up of my vital organs and my diet. You get to learn to your best ability, even there there is dramatic loss of communication between your physical well-being and your medical scientific understanding everyday in and out, of Mother Gaia and all of her forces, that the human body is under on a daily routine basis the only thing the human body does to exist for a general amount of 70-100 years orso' that it would amount to your personal journey along this groove of understanding that Mother Gaia is giving to us, the greatest medical discoveries come from her limbs and produce. Originally the species had no cause for concern of the predator amongst the scavenger or the omnivore because species had no destiny so many periods of animal extinction took place until we as a human race developed ourselves in the species historiography of earth species living animals. Then the predator took after the lizard and the humans made several comparisons to the beasts that the humans needed to hunt and kill for protection of everyone around us. The enemy with the humans is human. To understand her in Totality. Has yet to be done, by us the human species and how long have we been a species upon earth? In terms not that long of a time compared to the other elements in Mother Gaia. Organically, to Mother Gaia, we are relatively new because with any knowledge you have to summarize the qualities of the written human word. We have no idea what we are receptive to in this great world of nature and all of its contents. We just expect to know everything but never in its totality. Moving on to our living space and how we eat, our hygiene We as a species can no longer expect to walk, unscathed by all the forces Mother Gaia has to expect us there is too many unknowns for us to give a good standing and call ourselves accomplished intellectuals at this time point and being until that time is researched then we are more than just dim-witted and considered slow in terms of human brevity leading to our best chance of surival we as a human body have failed ourselves and we see the grotesque results and throw our human hands up expecting our problems to go away like some humankind. We need to start making returns to Mother Gaia and find the right balance between our existence and the fixed natural existence of our planet we call the Earth. Then this nature benefit would come to us and we could live in a better harmony with what organically through our biological creation living in a world that has absolutely nothing to name other than the sun and the stars resounding its existence as the only place habitable for human bodies after many ages of creation has perished until the human race with great tragedy has somehow survived and continues to presevere even with all of the violence taking away familymembers and all of the danger that comes with it in her throws, the human popluation rests under cement, iron, stell and wood. With the human body you have an explanation of what is large in this world, compared to what is very small. When you draw these comparisons you have a specific golden symmetry. What you find, can relate to other areas in a variety of interesting sciences designating on the specific research inquiry. Then you complete the research leading to Roze saying that the human body is running so efficiently. Like a quiet machine itis'revolving around its biological chemical physical properties. Living on hopefully until natural causes take effect. So the recipes, the diet, the human physiological response to then which is of leading data attributions databased which are kept lists of human processes to prove just how to better the human body of each individual depending on the individuals make-up. Indigestion and digestion tells us this. That is what the human desire is, to run your body to its fullest capability in fact we as a human race have yet to find its limits. So there is always new discoveries of how the human body reacts to a new impromptu although scientifically proven meaning positive affects leading to absolutely no downside of this. This is why this market is so popular. With regular exercise/ and with a regular in-take[]' of these medical, natural remedial benefits, you improve the on-going processes your human body is performing and that is from a daily, all-the-time, medical standpoint{.}' Roze can feel the most healthy and use his human body to its greatest capability leaving other experiences aside. This is a daily routine that should be required by all. So you have your body running in a manner, so efficient, that you can battle the common-cold better live a better life either in complete exercise or a chosen body weight where you are considered "fat-healthy" because this is the modern times where we can live at leisure and have ranging human diets to represent us. Its easy to be the weight that you want and to have a great time during your life with human exercise and as I, Roze, like to achieve the greatest form of body health because you can derive many pleasurable natural euphorias and have a product that you like to see either you want to be fat or in shape and both can achieve a form of good health. Now with your diet you have these mechanisms in place just to make your body run better every single day because it has to power your vital organs and sight and mind and physical health as you perform operate and live in within the conditions that you have only provided and then chose for yourself to live under, day in and day out. May you live in the best health that you can and live with your best bodie that you want and design your diets whether heavy desert style or light and lean to achieve the body image that you desire like so. Until then.
