I always like the look of @Reebok it seems they have big time
sponsorships && it looks great. This style has been around since
1958 so Roze is glad that the company is still in business we had a little
bit of a scare back when it was thinkin' it was going to go bankrupt && such.
So Roze is, once again, glad that is over. So you have a collection of shoes that
go with a, once again, collection of your favourite clothing. To match. Also Roze
thought that there basketball shoes are always lookin' sharp on the court. The
shoes are known for there comfart && versatality. When it comforms to your foot 
everything goes well. Roze means its a better time, effort && day.
