What I Am About To Say Is This.

*12*

roze was thinking
roze got a new lease on life
you know those old skool video games
well
they can be had here and then and at this
very
moment
you have to download and install
a
rom
player
and then set up all your downloaded
roms
but what if like theres guys
programming all of that originally
and now that its in the past
does that mean theyre still
programming
it?

*13*

Through the Grace of God.
Roze Perhaps Has Sumthin'
Here
Today.
I Was Also Thinking About
When We Wrote Down Our Calculations
We Wrought The Ending Part.
Leaving
The Beginning and Middle Up
For Us To Help
Figure
It
Out.

*14*

Placeboards of bone and muscle and blood
All and everything in nature isnt metal
When I look at the tools of medical science.
Everything about our body
is
a
natural
cleansing
organism, beyond belief.
The metal tools and the help devices and scan tombs
it
just
seems
the other way of human thought
when you could look
at it 6 different ways and then from there.
I have to find the medical faults
What if we could monitor our health
on a
24/7 all time basis?
Would this be a good practice?

*15*

as roze was saying
wait a moment
roze what do you have here
game over!
Now get lost
okay
so I do have a passion
for a point and click but really
you get the idea
So I should really followthrough
On that shouldnt I
So I will think about it later
Cheerio!
name roze.

*16*

when your out and you just dont have the perfect shoes on and 
you think to yourself I should of wore the others I would of had a much better time. 
To think as much is a hardship already and I lost the track of time which means I am 
searching for the latest timepiece that assures me that I am here and living amongst.

Its time.
The times.
It was time.
Been a good time.
Had a good time.
Thanks for the time.
I then got the drift.
I am away from the phone at this moment.

*17*

See what comes next is.
The lard.
The cooking utensils.
And then the hardships.
The waiting and then the more
waiting.
Down the line.
Where you get good enough at sumthin'
Then your really goin places.
Here today.
When it was just all as well, right before
That the thing happened.
So from here on out all of us.
Better batten down the hatch.
And where going to live like animals.
See its quite similar.
Nothing else to add.
I said
I'm timed out.
Kaput.

*18*

If we could have better advantage
points
there would be more room to jump around
and everybody comes over eventually
you know the time and place.
That is when you will expel your spirit
like some overdone turkey.
Its an exhale and boy did it need rest.
Hereby.
Doo dads today.
gazooks.

*19*

Here I am.
Where was you last time.
I dont know running around and in my mind.
All thoughts to myself.
Where I just become this carousel of sorts.
It isnt my first time around the 'rosie.
I figured that out for myself.
Did I find all the fans that I have.
This is so different for me.
Usually I am just a nobody that nobody remembers.
Now I have one of the most recognizable faces
on the planet.
I cant get over it.
I'm in a state of awe. This is
Everything that I could of wanted.
and then sum more and even more.
I want to go see a concert
that everybody on earth
at one time or another
would go see.
That is the show I wanna go to.
"No excuses."

*20*

He was coming on down the bend.
He went up around and got the job done.
She kept to the house.
All around the animals settled and dinner was put on the table.
I just worked a hard day.
Nobody saw.
That hard earned day thru hard work.
Nobody but him will profit.
Farmers give us so much.

@jodyandthehighrollers

*21*

What could come of this.
Is this art.
Is this hopelessness.
Is that what it looks like.
Take me back and a far.
To the jungles.
Of concrete.
Where I find my best human brevity
Where I feel the most free.
Where I can relate and be emboldned.
In a neighborhood perfectly solitary
For my own use and good.
Let the bitches where low cut tops and tight shorts.
To show the boys, where its at.

*22*

Quasimodo anyone?
Or else what?
What is their else.
I only see the life I should live.
But everyone is thinking @yamahaboating.
&& what fun those have && what those entail.
How could you see!?
I've been here dog.
Now lay me to rest.
Forever shall I keep the peace
within inside myself.
To be known, is divine.
Should be, more takeOut available to the homeless.

*23*

What could it be other than namaste.
Stead.
Your a powerful precursor.
Why don't you set up the criminal enterprise
In a day care.
In the elementaries.
That would be a safe place
for it.
You criminal masterminds.
By its design these systems that you put to use
have no faults and can
capture and condemn
without any cause or justifiication.
Jus' word of mouth.
Finally it has backfired on ya'll.
Its a brilliant model with a Head of Steam.
No more.
Enough.
Wait.
I must buy more time in order to live free
and await the punishment of my horrific crimes
that I have done
under the guise
of good.
The traitors.
The enemy is within', amongst us.
and that is where it is the most dangerous.
Forgive me.
Beg for mercy.
You received a sadastic pleasure when we did the
same.
Now always remember
that.

*24*

What is behind you.
Is it darkness.
Then what is exactly in front of you.
Is it light.
Did you make it.
I did today.
At the Bezazian.
Here at a public library where I cannot catch
to see any innocent children
but I saw a group of the mentally ill and
they tell 'em how to take a piss and where to take
a ***t.
Its as simple as that.
We all remember
the reason
marijuana
was first
legalized
was because
our brethren
needed it the most.
Now lets all look back at each other and
see our differences further drawing us apart
let us embark and see us in the distance.
Its more formal
More family orientated
and all of that good good and nonesense.

*25*

Is their sumthing real on the other side of this?
I cannot believe it for myself.
Futhermore
What did you just do?
Did you cum near me?
How come you ain't over there on your side
of things,
yet.
As of yet.
To be known.
Been always known.
Straight out of the -Chi.
Were we call it ChiRaq.
Because it is in simile
of what is happenin'
across the world, here today.
The human race will never cease to exist.
Believe me they have tried
their best.
&& their bestest.
Tested.
Truly Tested, throughout time.
Blue Eyes, Bye-Bies.

*26*

When I told you sumthin?
What did you do with it?
Exactly.
What is this
your lookin' at?
Is it another looking glass of yours, roze?
No its a piece.
I said it myself.
Couldnt have said better if I had done it.
Now.
Nah and all of that jazz.
Could be more than me.
Myself.
That is all.
For now.
Goodbye.
Wait is their more afterbirth comin' up
Out of your filth whore?
Did I Say, Daddy.
"He Would Like You To Go See Him."
Why?
Exactly So.
So, So and All of that Jazz.
Hiccups.
Had me before and than I got
Rid' of 'em.
Nomores.
I said.
My body is a natural cleansing mechanism.

*27*

When It Gets Like This
Its So Completed, Complicated!
When it doesnt need to be.
How come?
I do not understand myself sumtimes.
Now
All I see is a world of my own making
'Of What Dreams May Come'
Starring
One of those favourite actors
of ours.
What a way to go out, he said.
Never again.
Should I bring up these thoughts and feelings
That touch me
In ways
I cannot describe.
I feel safe.
But Am I Really?
At this Day and Age,
Like I Said, 'Who Knows.'
Til' Tomorrow
we will see
eachother again.
I Hope.
With all of the
Might.
In my sweet little body.

*28*

Bearing straits.
Mathematical Notations.
Could be more than you.
I am worth more than you.
Hold on to what you have
because this body is worth more than
Yours.
That is all.
As it just continues to accrue the coin
what would of happened if
Roze
would of got a jail sentence?
Or viciously beaten to a pulp?
Would the daemon
of changed its course
programmed into our statutaries?
Our governments?
Thats a bigger question than I.
I cant even die right after more than
6ix years and counting.
I am afraid.
@mcdonalds.
I have 5, $5 dollar gift cards.
In my possession.
For myself. All by myself
sitting in wait and
In the future.
The breakcast.
Soon to be. Maybe
I gets to go
2wice a week. Perhaps.
Now a later.

*29*

Now here you can tell
which band Roze was listening to
I am not going to play around with you.
Its Swans,
the cd album called "The Seer."
Young God Records.
it was released on August 28, 2012.
Which was a
fairly
good
Fall
day.
It was one of my best memories
Just about to graduate with my
associate in science
which I knew
would be my ticket
and that is all that I needed
to live the, @neiulife for a B.S.
and I listened to it in the heart
of my own home, my families home.
To me.
Unto me.
You get the idea.
Now as for the rest of you.
To better know the weather
as this was the subject in the
first place
you would then as a person
be better
inclined to attack
that
un-sweet
living
day which is ours
To behold, @drinkarizona Tea.
and then
begin
again.
As it was said.
If we know the weather
better
we know the area
better
around us.
Know what to accomplish
and most of all
Dress appropriately.
Today.

*30*

This could be sumthin' new.
But as I remember
how
it
was
before.
These men were already
outcasted
by the
good
innocent
and very pleasing
no matter
the caliber
women
by
us.
The poor men of good
who faced
ridiculous
amounts
of sexual deprivation
but that
was over
half a decade ago
already
and all they had was money
so it was very easy to
rape a person
What I mean to say is
All the women
are safe
For good.
Thanks to be
Allah.
For that.
As well.
We have a good reminder
of all those nasty
recurring dreams.
Where they hook onto us
with no
solution.
Look no further.
There.
I had it once.
Now I am famous.

*31*

When You Just
Dont Care
and You Shake It All About
and You do a song called, "Hokey Pokey"
and You realize what they have done to your body
and That its full game.
You have nothing to guard it.
You cannot afford a guard system.
This is poor town and you live in it.
So be it. As it has been said.
Is it because you have no choice in the matter?
Is that why your question is filled like Air in your body?
Does it matter what I do with the answer?
Thas' good. Well that was alot of fun.
As they say.
Cheerio is another but I would like to see you try?
Would any good man make it all this way so far?
You could say that.
Thanks. I said
Goodbye.
To-la lou?
Have a good time. I'll be back here when you see me.
Meet me at home.
Alright.
What does that mean.
It means what you think it means.
Then its my next favourite thing O My God.
When it came to this, what did you do?
Well I had it once. Then tried another time.
When could I come over you say?
When was the last time?
Why couldnt it of happened this way?
C-Ya Later.

*32*

Here comes the heart of the matter.
O' no! what does that mean.
Did you always wanna be a poet
Idk.
I heard it was ok its another way to entice
the women around me that are being held from me
so that means I cannot live the life
that I want.
Homeless.
Job with a place living with these very criminals?
Living at your sexual slave home? Face Down?
Its really only these
three
options.
Then
the
continued
waiting
as you dont want to
gnaw
at the wound
all of the
time.
That would be pessimistic.
However
you would like to be opportunistic.
But what would
that then
make the rest of the world.
That would make
the world into one big pot of gold
like a
bowl of
@luckycharms.
Then with a piece of bread
in your
favourite
toppin'
so it would go all
nice.
Then you would proceed to satisfy your
bowels and just say
to yourself
that you have rewarded yourself for a hard days
work and this is perfectly nutritious and good enough to get you to that next meal.
Where you will find the remnants of that
very
bowl
of
cereal.
You once had.
Then your again
eating another lunch and that will save time
until Dinner.
Where everybody gathers 'round
and gets fat.
Until the tusk of salt is in
each leg
roze's belly and hips
shoulders and chest
guts and hearts and heads
then arms.
So Roze requires a salt
at all times
when roze eats
any kind of sandwich.
To this day.

*33*

What does roze have here?
Roze says hes got another
piece
for you all
to enjoy at this time.
When we had luck what did we then
do with
the said luck?
Did we place it sum'where unbeknownst?
Could that be the place for it?
ANd wouldn't you happen to know it.
This is the same day as it was before and
the next.
After that their wouldnt be anymore
nexts and then a shot rang out across the trees
nobody knows what happened say it happened in the
past
already would be a good
guesstimation.
Where at that time all hands are up in the air and
anything goes
and there is no way out and that means everybody
sustains sum kind of damage if people are scott-free
than that means
the espionage than has
failed.
Everyone here and everyone in the future.
Further meaning
that this is the life that has come and there is
no way out.
Once again.
So you begin.
To the think about your alternatives
and those are very limited
no matter
which life
you have lived
in this
day
and
age.
Where you could be dancing around one day and
nobody
is the wiser.
If you were to be the most wise.
For that would naturally draw
attention
of the
worst and best kind.
So be wary
at all times and keep a watch and always jump look
over your shoulder to keep away that sweet
sweet
sweet ol' Evil.
The man and women that own everything
we see and can operate
rather easily
anywhere
at any time.
This sector of psychotic peoples
showcasing
cannibalism.
Innocent bloodshed would be
a trade of theirs.

*34*

Whats this here?
What you got there?
I said
Put it there then.
Why would ya have sum'thin' like that now?
How could you possibly
come across
it?
I didnt say where you got it from
that ain't none of my concern?
My belief is that it belongs to sum'body else
now who is it?
You gonna tell me or not?
Did I say you
would want
me to tell you?
Well than whats
the problem?
Did I say their is one?
1?
Or did I say sum'thin else entirely
relating to the subject
once again
at hand.
Did you hear me out?
Why should I?
Goodbye.

*35*

What once was stone.
Is now cuttlefish.
And you find yourself in
a sushi bar
but you dont remember how you got
there.
So theres that.
And you seem to find
yourself
movin'
on.
And all of that trivial drivel
where it becomes hard to manage
the amount of
that you need to understand and then
contain
once amongst these other words its very
hard to
preserver
through
hard times
as these
we have before us.
When all it takes is a person standing and the
other person
to do another job completely and move on.
With other things
to do.
As any other person
would agree
that this is where we find ourselves at this moment();
Cumbersome.

*36*

When your in a room.
Ok.
And then you forgot sumthing
sum'where else.
And you just cant seem to place it.
Than Roze has the admittance.
For we need to go to
this rebound.
Where you see heaven and you just
cant stand it.
Than laying the pieces down
let the pieces fall where they may
so it can be all fair
And righteo and flush and complete and albatross.
Where it happens over again than.
You lean in and say
is this
the part
where I have to go say sumthin'
to another?
What did roze accomplish?
Nothing at all?
Let it
at least
mean sumthing.
Its a face
looking up
after a few drinks.
Than a Man
sitting looking
with a
necessity
glare and aloof and persay a perhaps and full time
are you now?
Thats great to hear
nothing will change
than roze
lights a candlestick
And everything is still all of a sudden.
Where you keep reading this for
sumthin'
what else do you expect roze to
give ya?
Poof. Jiffy. Haved. Plural. Henny. Yet. But. Tidings.

*37*

to get by.
But what is that you needed in the first place?
You said.
It was for sum'thin else than
I guess
I dont mind.
It could mean more than you think it means Roze.
But what would that then be?
Sum kind of deal we got goin' on?
Winner take all.
All I said was
is
when the goin' gets tough
the tough get' goin.
All the way
out of there.
Scrammed.
Like sum kind of
candy apple
you think u is?
Your real conversation turnin' and attention grabbin'
Where we need you the most we will be able to place you.
When I said the time was this.
Did you believe it?
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Roze?
Gots 2 get goin? C'est la Vie. Tedious. Bröst. Bantam Banter.

*38*

What do we have here?
A whole another piece?
Why
What is the circumstance.
I said.
Get started on it today and tomorrow.
It will all
be gone.
When it was still a fad.
Whenever sumthing is
than that
means
the time has
changed.
Here we go.
Down the hierarchical.
When it comes time.
For the last note to be played and you paid your bill.
With a good tip for the girl.
Once again, at hand and
at a moments notice.
I will begin.
Another time
sum place other or even else.
Could be the mark
I have now.
O' would you look at this irreversible damage that
has
been
done onto me.
I cannot believe it for myself.
I should be heading off
now as
I said before.
Wouldnt you wanna tag along
I am not sure you would want to go this
route
I am afraid.
I am very afraid.
Than you hit a wall and its the choice or else.
Than you begin to shop for other properties.
Than its all said and done.
Like I said.
Before.
Complete, Verified, Benedictine, Every, Toodles.

*39*

Then roze is asking when the next time
will be
and that is the most
sillyest
question you gotta ask
in a very long time.
When there used to be walls up around
individuals.
The wall. Mind walls.
and made it hush hush and pass.
Then look at
where we all
wound up
So roze says.
Til' next time
well what if there isnt
going to be a next time?
What will roze do then?
Roze dont know.
See.
However roze could find out if roze makes it all the way.
Thats up for grabs && everything else is for that matter.
Well I got to be
goin' now.
But you just got here.
Howd a real page turner like yourself get down here?
How would you like it
if you went sumplace that you didnt wanna?
Would your commercial famous body look good
on the news channels.

*40*

Than sumthing appeared and roze
proceeded to draw it and in a sense color it.
By default. This is what roze has.
So be it.
It hits the right notes.
And all of that jazz. Whole lot. I would say so.
Wouldnt it be yet again?
What does that entail?
That this could happen.
When your last on your life and mends.
Which means who you mend yourself throughout
the living day.
I just get so interested
when I think
about how well designed of a self-cleaning
organism
that we
have at our disposal.
Just mostly evaporates within roze and leaves as waste.
If roze is on the correct path as roze knows it.
At least. So were at. You go again. Hand it over.
When you got a least 3 in the tank.

*41*

now roze sees 6 figures.
Boy do you really know how to hit a face.
Parabolas.
Gaussian Equations.
Leibniz Notation and Scope.
Newton Realizations and Laws.
When was the last time.
Well it was just
a mere
as you get the idea and the general point
of the matter at hand.
Than roze begins to go to other places.
Only roze can go to these places.
Is that true roze?
This is the only thing that is true.
Roze is here.
When was the last time you left a place
to go to
another place?
Was it entirely and did it come
all of a sudden?
What exactly
Roze is
getting at
is this.
When able. Usually comes thru.
In all that is all.
When could you use it? U say it could be as early
as possibly this week?
Thas' good.
Roze hear from you later.
I would say so myself.
Better job done
than I could of done it myself.

*42*

Again it did come out this way roze came out to be.
It came out in these colours that roze in fact selected.
To be pronounced in the best of ways.
It could very well be to pass the time.
Roze dont know really when it comes to this.
Its time just to get rid of it?
When could that be?
Heard it was along the same time as the other time
it was.
When roze is running a double schedule for other reasons.
When you have time all by yourself and roze only has
so far to go. This has become rather
tedious
as roze would like to think. Its a hardship and actually it
ain't easy.
To be honest.
Than roze has to scrange.
Roze must look like roze can handle a
little leg work and get a [1-2] job done. So always be
on your feet, roze.
At all times.
This is when it was the last time to touch the ball and roze
gets all excited but really roze watches the entire court
at this time.
Roze looks for other things in the whimsy.

Years gone by. Haven't you looked. Hit me back.
Just rock it. Your all I want. You'll hear from me.
Can't believe it either. A bowl of laughs.
Party wrecker. Fun wrecker. Home wrecker.
Don't ruin my high. Cluster f**k. Yet again.

*43*

what does roze want to say.
what would roze like to say.
let roze speak for himself.
lying over there you think roze
had it comin?
Dont we all do?
Whenever it comes time for that roze thinks to himself
And says this
well
till the time roze heart stops beating
all of a sudden.
Than roze would know at that time that a hospital wont help
that remark.
When it came time for roze to
well
only roze knows
at that time.
Times shared.
Times gone.
Times are a changing.
Thats what they always do
is it cuz' you dont really get
along
with Time?
Is that why roze is always at odds and
ends?
Is that why roze brought this here.
What does Roze have?
Roze has a ukulele and a loaf of bread,
wheat, havent touched and a clear glass bottle.
Last but not least, a fire bellow.
All ready.
To be of use.
To your likin'.

*44*

After this pieces completion roze realized
that the middle
is the hardest to pull off and the calling card
if you will
what draws
other than a roze
in.
Roze is shooting for
his GRLfwuends
wouldnt that be sumthin'
to pass the time
actually roze designed
this roze persona
hence roze's character mantra
if you will
once again.
To better identify with what his
G-i-rlFriENenndDs
like the best.
Because this
is what really matters.
Roze's reachin out to
'most likely'
them.
Because you know why
well
roze is in the
pen.
Their daddy is in the big house.

*45*

When you get into sumthin' like this.
Whats the matter.
Is it all that is their?
But I see transposed images, three images
forming one off
into the distance now
for it was in-between
the two gold copper wires of perception.
Like an ol'timey movie.
There now its all gone.
And often the most beautiful of breathtakin' images.
Last only so long.
Roze is having fun being famous.
It looks like for the entirety of Roze's famed life.
Unless
you know
he takes
a
brake.
Roze likes being famous
for business or as an intellectual.
Roze isnt good at being famous for being a showman.
Famous feels good all the time.
Like a flower with sun.

*46*

Roze has realized
when it comes to these
Abstractions.
These skeletal remarks.
are in fact
quid pro quo.
What does that mean exactly?
..(a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something.)..>/sik^3/p>
or in other words.
"One hand washes the other"
its a simple as that.
Why are you lookin' here?
You think you can get a job sellin' those magazines
that you like to read
little' citrus honey pop of the
sweetest
very sweet
kind.
Thats exactly
what a
girll__.,
look like.
To roze.
Hes a simple flavor and girls world type of guy.
Thats all roze is looking for
the compatibility and a little girls world.
No matter the age.
What could be worse?
For that matter.
Why dont you start all over again.
What good would that be?
I fell for it.
I don't really know or remember what
I exactly
said.
But I looked like a dufus.
And this is most
direct
desired response.
Who knows
who is
innocent
these
days.
Back when you had it like when you got it.
Thats when the cumbersome gentile comes thru():
Take me thru.

*47*

Whats it like..
Do you have a good table?
Is it sturdy?
Is it built well?
Do you need another fire
because is that what you is
lookin' for.
Than you won't find it here.
Youll find it over there.
Where you first started.
Take your friends and your
exciting times to be had.
Over sum'place else.
Really Roze saw this in the past
in, the,
olden days. Rozes time to speak.
Of all the faceDowns
sailing on,
"The Ship of Only the Begotten"
culminated in sum type of meeting place
maybe one of the, 1,
heavily favourited
meeting places.
A music and comedy and arts festival.
Back when it doesnt suck.
It isnt having sex with the customer against its will.
And just worries about having a good time.
That be neat. Aint it!

*48*

When you find.
Yourself sitting aloft.
And everything seems to be in the right place.
It only happens sumtimes,
this does.
But however roze would be surprised.
very. Roze would surprise you.
To find the light in all of the things
we hold dear
&& that which roze wants
to toss out
well Roze aint gotta
hold it no more.
Juice Luck.
Tame Paler. Vux Buttons. Strike A Tone.
"Victory lap."
Where we hold in our hearts and minds.
What we hold.
These tragedies.
Americana No longer.
For those who have suffered
grotesquely
brutally ripped from their
normal thinking patterns that make us human
ruining their jeans in fright
And pissing themselves.
In the hopes that perhaps.
Roze can live just one more day.
With my loved ones.
Thats all Roze wants.
All the while.
Roze is giving
good ol' Evil
exactly what eevil wants to see.
And that is to be a complete object
a pet
a play-thing
a farm animal,
what have you
"you name it."
Like Roze has said.
Time to hang it up.
Say, nevermore.
Guiltless, gutless, yellow belly
peevy, pretentious, finicky, prissy, prickly
cocksuckers.

*49*

When you get like this, roze?
Do you think of others?
Or are you a rather solitary man and like your alone time?
Wouldnt that be nice.
If Roze could.
Make you sumthin'
For that is why Roze made a piece.
Such as this.
To be known.
And then once again very unknown and not cared about
And at the same time.
Whats this, its just computer scientist lingo;
You get the drift? Mine.
How is roze speaking to other than myself?
Roze doesnt know sumtimes but
better often
than not
Roze figures it out. Like sum' kind of robot
moving around his humaniod world with all of these
forces acting upon Roze.
Like sum' kind of
ontological
light scope and Reducer and trash heaper.

*50*

When it comes to instead...
is it alot like
luck?
Do you have the need for the sticky icky?
I smoke better weed than you.
Its very hard to get above the 'reggie'
in order for roze to get
actually good
'productive'
And good for Roze's 'thinking processes.'
And you know just that
el' natural
medical.
That the strand is jus'
a better
breed.
With all the necessary chemicals out
to give a better experience.
So its always a struggle.
But as roze has said.
Roze lives in poorTown.

The hottest girl that has ever made a pass at me.
Roze Does Not Care about anything
else that came into her decision.
It was expressed.
Forever in that moment.
Another reason to live.
These criminals might try
to taint it
But that ain't happenin'

Everything roze knows can be simplified.
Everything Roze knows of can be used against Roze.
This is a dangerous world.
Always at eachothers throats.
And all of that jazz.
Could it be you? Very well. Get out. Furthermore.
Well tell me when you got it.
So roze can 'had it.

*51*

Congratulations.
Now Roze feels like
Roze is at @sixflags
Great America!
Where you need to wear proper-
-floppy-shoes.
Where you need to go with an empty
but at the
same damn time
a mildy full to light, stomach.
Jus' a couple snacks
to hold you over!
You loose cannon!
Jesus.
Btw its all 'insta'
from now on.
Even though
its impossible to tell.
Jus' who is
trying to create an account
with a name and an email address.
And the pencil. Here it is.
Tweet-Tweet machine, requires a telephone# number.
NewsFeed.
Does it work wit da' phone?
Maybe. ou curls.
'Roze is gunna say it.'
Rozes ..been.. sayin' it all the time.
Roze cant make it jus
wit
this.
Jus' the poet
ry and the abstract roze has.
I need my NEON, Multi-million
$dollar$
enterprize, love
Shaun McGovern.
Ben Zariatnatmik.
Roze. name roze.
Son of God.
Saviour of Mankind.
You know the 'x' on the nort
'cide.
ya' dig.

*52*

...l.([])..
Clueless
why is it so big with the girls.?
But really is a tight pussy and a good amount of
tits
And a make or break amount of Ass.
Really life-changing.
Is it based off of the man's eye?
Because as a man, roze.
Roze has to like looking at it all the time.
Pick' rozes' fancy.
Thas' all. Rather Superficial as protection.
But again.
Rozes got a big-forgiving more room for
all enough
of albeit range. Type of thang.
When it comes to any and all women out there for Roze.
But what really roze
is only sayin'
is that their needs to be
sexual attraction
and tha' is all.
Than roze goez' home
happy, as a man.
Roze has many businesses to run.
Roze has alot of money to move around.
Roze is jus' going to throw money around.
Like Roze jus' don't care.
Watch roze, do. Man of his word, this roze is.
Real polish loyal NAND sheet.

*53*

Roze dont plan nuttin' when
'nething is bein'
Said.
Thru vocal inflection that can be used for Lies.
Pretty little lies.
When it comes to a piece.
Such as this.
Albatross.
Which is a bird and not a [feasche].
Like your are thinkin' alongside of, ?roze.
A Roze to be
exact.
You dont
need
to GoogleIt.
The buugés
are jus' naturally all around the money these women get a bad wrap hence more stereotypes.
Roze jus'
told yo' Ass.
Which is beautiful cuz.
It reminds us that we are all the same.
And this is Hinduism and the first lesson Roze
took away from visiting the temple.
Furthermore.
Lets hurry up and get Roze's, ♊☦🈶
im talkin that 3️⃣1️⃣4️⃣ released.
Ah, 🎹 there kinda but ya' is that better?
So. Everybody can goe to a concert.
And live normal lives and livelihoods.
Once again better
Or jus' like everory Sats and Suns.
That you can personally see in the Sky.
If dey didn't have to amputate your eyeballs
And by the miracle of God, several miracles are jus'
beginning to happen.
And has happened.
And will happen.
And all of those,
happenings around.
Like spirits designated, engineered witch is made
To better use our world as a whole.
For your own and once again.
Rozes.
Roze also thut about the similarity between feelin'
rather quite fancy and important and looked up to
in da' 'hood. Is comparable to
what the
simple minded buugés
also want to discover
and want.

*54*

Now what Roze sees
is truly rozes muse.
For these criminals in Darkness.
Have decided to make it ever so very
personal.
Ever since the motorcade' of my Uncle's
funeral.
"Anything for the lu"
This is how a good man dies.
Stripped.
Right back at you.
Even tho' that moment was heavy
its gives us and roze has all the time in the
world to think about our losses and rozes losses.
How that goez' is
and such. When.
Where eating, is rare.
Even more, so, rare.
Than ever! Before.
Hear roze out.
Let me get right back atch ya'
At things.
Of those. At.
Once again, albatross.
Roze really likes that word.
" "
Likes moments times, hit me up.
Better more.
For everyone and we all start dancing and then
everybody gets protective and thinks about
themselves because at the end of the day its
only Roze and rozes loved ones.
And roze has jus' gotta hunker down.

*55*

I mean roze likes his openness.
What doez that entail exactly?
Well for one thing roze ya look dumb
and roze jus has that kinda body type where it needs
to be lead along
and when roze comes to think about it
roze really has no place at all and in this world
which is rozes it can come crashing down at any second.
Nothing and Nobody is giving roze the guarantee.
Why would their be one, roze?
Well you let roze ask the questions now.
And no more of this middle-grass.
Only final, high, fidelity. Courageous ye?
Yes roze, since roze isnt in any form of illegal activity, yes.
That is the sole reason roze stays alive, yes?
Because roze need a reason and A reason after that
To die.
Essentially.

*56*

This wordplay isnt an, Roze original.
It predates way back to when the first original
poets and musers. Can think aback to the point-in-history
When we brought harmony to the human race thru
edible, pleasing, beautiful adjectives that give life
to the lifeless.
Futhermore bringing more meaning to our words.
As roze only speaks english.
But when
roze gets down to it all emotion and meaning
from all written languages that roze knows of.
Is a description of what is currently happening ||
is about to happen.
To better describe the motion that Roze in facts sees.
Like hieroglyphics and the sun God.
Ra.
As the human race has all migrated from certain points
in human history.
Did the human race start from one place than the other place.
What does our nationalities tell us about Roze
and where the human race is headed as
it jus' continues to persevere forth.
And pressforth as such. Human bodies.

*57*

When it was like this.
Do you always Wonder?
Well when I first laid my eyes on it
Roze thought it was special.
Held special powers
tasted different
But what from what Roze remembers
is that it went perfect with
a jam
a jelly
a grape preservative
and rozes creamy or crunchy PB
Peanut Butter is good either way.
Now Roze dont get me started.
But how do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you think this is Roze?
Roze enjoys a sandwich time.
He likes to feel whole and subnourished.
And Eat it and finish it whole. Completing it. Moving on.
Subnourished you say?
Ya.
That feeling you get when your eating and knowing it will
power 'Roze on for the rest of the day
So Roze can play?
So Roze can play.
@wonderbreadusa.

*58*

'Fandazzled'
This is beginning to become cumbersome
where Roze is walking around with various sad faces
and lethargic times acomin'
where Roze is beginning to get-it-in.
After this amount of time its hard
but that story is Boron.
Where everybody across the world
can use their ooglers to witness.
Roze believes that this isnt the first time
that the public and local information
have lied to us which in turn is the public.
With various propagandas and their chosen stories.
You would have Roze believe This and That!
How so.
What Roze is trying to do. Is
This.
Promote
a business that is very versatile and money-driven,
A multi-million $$ollar 'bidness to be
Exact.
Which, Where Roze is using his ok-leaning
to good and studied,
its ok but alright, thats good enough,
whats your real name, o is it Shaun ok thanks.
I guess.
Abstract Art. to further education.
if(not for you || your style)
return yourFlavour;
Then Roze begins to work with $Rozes selected business partners, which are
businesses Roze does 'bidness wit.
Further promoting these ideas and all the while at the same time, marketing.
In the meantime, Roze offers
a 'Tidbit
perhaps a piece of thought, which what roze likes to call an
$$'Informerrational'$$ times.
Then in the same-ti_er-sy_stem as the musicScene.
Thats why you have to, you just have to.
As roze has.
C'heck out h_is tweet tweet page, maybe even his 'business professional' page.
Then get into R_oze's code source and view page,
jus' to see how Roz_e is feelin'
What this does is create
an Intellectual Property Hero and Insignia.
An Exquisite Man '#xmenworldwide' and His Brand,
Intellectual Property. @champagnepapi

*59*

this is a face.
But is it?
What does that mean, Roze that u see
blue faces
all of the time
or is it jus' sumtimes.
Lookin' at you Roze. it would make it perfectly fine to agree.
That your worth millions. Billions even. Perhaps trillions.
What u mean.
Me and my ideas.
Well then you got a good idea about yourself.
And u got
a good idea about me.
Isnt that jus what u jus did?
Jus who dis that?
Roze. Well that feels good cuz I'm face down
and sh*t. You know the classic.
But enough of the backtrackin'
and what e'vil has
been
done onto me.
Is it another losing battle?
F**k what u say. Not today. Not ever.
Not around me, Roze is trying to build his own
personal paradise
kan't u see dat?
Back off.

*60*

Mmm
Whats good?
Nuttin'
I jus' got the first breath of life.
Call it fresh
to the gates and then once again
On-back.
To be more is to be known and is it all that their
Is?
In fact you get
more engrossing
more intoxicating
the more Roze has to look at you.
Where roze is jus twirlin'
It ain't that serious
but once again
to the girls
it moves
quite a bit more
'forward thinkin'
than men
have previously known.
We come from different places as they say.
Roze included.
Jus' so you know Roze is only meant for one
Purpose.
And what is that, Roze.
Roze doesnt know anymore, ok.
Roze is jus tryin' to better his life and have good
beneficial outcomes for Roze and others.
Well Roze, where does that leave you?
What did I jus say?
You mean what Roze said?
Nah.
Forget it.
To be more.
Qualified and thats all that their is.

*61*

This is where Roze doesnt really remember exactly
But Roze is getting a new bodie.
Entirely.
So it really doesnt matter.
To Roze.
And nobody else for that matter.
Even tho' the matter is given.
That could make it more removed from the
very fact.
That in turn, Roze.
Well.
Lets jus' say. Roze had it comin'
But to Roze it wasnt understood.
But ya see Roze doesnt kneed to understand it.
If Roze did than it wouldnt be understood.
In the first place, although Roze.
What is it now Roze.
Roze would like to better understood.
Roze doesn't even know what that means.
Roze doesnt even know where to begin.
Roze is starting from the beginning again and again.
All over the place, this Roze is.
Roze doesnt even know what is best for him.
Roze in turn would in fact be had.
This Roze is.

*62*

when you made this did u think it was pretty?
Roze?
U there?
Did Roze think that it was 'done, ur askin'?
Well you take a 'look at it
As Roze has.
Then we reach a simultaneous conclusion.
Which we then draw
from what Rozes value,
exactly is.
But Roze is tryin' to tell u.
It isnt jus'
Rozes abstract and poetry tryin' to make it.
To the top.
Its Rozes, business entrepreneurial concept.
Like what Roze does on his tweet tweet page.
Almost on a daily basis.
Further proving,
Further leading by example,
Further pursuing,
Further tasking,
where exactly Education can lead us.
Where the problems are
there is always
an Academic Solution. Period!
Bottom line.
Like geometry, like calculus, like Physics.
u sayin' Roze?
Which is the expression of dire Logic.
At its best.
So Roze thinks.
if you wanna be one
you could
and should
check it out.
Maybe make urself into one
like Roze has said,
then focus on future business together.

*63*

is dis' what u waz lookin' for.
Well
Roze is happy.
very happy to be able to
help you out.
But o' know here Roze is here goin' again.
Is that ok will that be alright if you dont mind,
to occupy your mind space
that is rightfully yours?
And did u sell it to me and did Roze purchase it.
Too late.
Say now or u'll be sorry.
Where everything falls apart
there here we are.
Lets begin
But Roze jus' did?
What do you mean?
Exactly.
Well another world of its own.
In its own world, as they say.
In the books.
In the real world.
In the business world.
In the playgrounds across America.
In the schools, in the social world, in the online world.
But what if we did this, Roze?
Wouldn't that be nice?
Well.
Roze would then in fact
be having a very good day.
Roze will see you later. ok.
Bye-bye.

*64*

Now it got 'real in here.
💞
But whats the matter.
Do you not jus wanna stand around
Any Longer?
And jus' feel completely and utterly hopeless.
But why should we be and Roze for that matter?
When we have everthing in place to conquer
the problems, hence deriving the solutions.
Roze believes we have every system in place
and by that every single, tool, available to us.
To help us, protect us, safeguard us.
Forevermore and thats by design.
As Roze would like to believe, wouldn't he?
Roze would have you believe that.
But what is what
others believe
'these days? I ask you.
You mean the ones
who control
the business world, the law enforcement,
I can buy judges. I can buy politicians.
If you need to.
Roze are u saying that everything in this world
has a price, $$?
Is that what you are sayin.
Roze?
I'm sayin it is rather well known.
Pool Party. Never been?
Had to.

*65*

When I was u did u miss it?
What
are u
exactly
saying,
exactly.
Terrible buns never drums.
However horoscopes is of my nature.
Whenever I get like this, I like to play the field.
But
what do that mean by what u axin'?
Is it better than last time.
Thats what Roze wants to do
he wants to get good at it and get good at it
sum' mo.
Roze did u jus' say sumo.
No. But I do enjoy the history of sumo wrestling.
As the greats.
Have yet to be surpassed.
As they will forever live in history as.
Its more than eating.
It looks like all muscle but fat.
then the classic fighting outfits.
As it is rather humbiling but at the same time.
The same, damn, time.
Very sexaully pleasing for the female.
To watch the dance.
Like Street Fighter, SNES.

*66*

Dont ya jus ❤️ rollercoasters.
Especially @sixflags, Great America!
Where you can ride one
can Roze get motion-sickness on that 1.
Well thas' perfectly fine. But make sure.
You have a bite to eat that is, 'ready.'
Make sure you take a counterActive
motion sickness pill
or just brace yourself.
Because it removes the fun, the sickness.
And then sum' kind of mirror.
Where Roze today is at a loss
4 words.
And then various construction crane ideas.
For the betterment of the entire human race.
Usually roze jus' types until the words run-out.
Like 'doze pills.
But sober is really good too.
The memory is more warm
However enjoying a variety of substances,
in moderation, is rather vivid as well.
Like that Gaspar Noé film.
As that is one of Roze's favourite directors,
now you know.
That was one of Roze's recommendations.
For he thoroughly enjoyed it and had a
once again,
an-out-of-body experience.
For that is what transcendentalism
truly is.
To remove yourself of the natural.
Begin the spiritual. Onsetting, Resting.
Existentialism. Whats the difference
these days thats up to you.
As Roze is asking alot of questions?
p's and q's, mind you.

*67*

Well
when it gets like this.
Congrats.
Pulled it off once again.
Did I now, Roze?
Who is exactly, speaking?
Your mouth, your lips, your very vocal cords?
Moving in accordance of syllables in a guttural
belly trac, I mean your trachea?
Thats what Roze means.
Well that could be an example.
But why fill your cheeks and lungs
with such questions.
That would be selfish.
And a waste of yo' time.
And who you like too and how you like eachother.
As well.
Wouldn't that be fair?
Roze loves fairs and old timey' places and country towns
and get-togethers.
Especially block parties.
Where we get to jus' know who
lives in the neighborhood
and exactly what they do.
However the specialty.
As they perform it on
a daily basis
becoming what they do.
In-fact.
It resonates in them and how they move around in the
community. 😊
Where everyone is filled with glee' and happiness.
But also remember you must have the sadness.
What would life be without it?
Well.
A petting zoo. I am afraid, a corn on the cob and
one of those elephant ears please.
A ferris wheel ride it is then.
Ta-ta.

*68*

Like this
is a shooting star!
Oh my God!
OMG.
Now presenting the very own,
But to each
a delicacy.
For it invertebrates
like across its own likelihood...
Furthermore, outstanding
the very nature
of our species.
It did what it had to do to survive!
Even furthermore, you begin to discuss
the nature of
the 'poppy
the fruit that breaks forth, to reveal its inner
deliciousness.
Once again, a delicacy.
Where we are all here forthrite.
But especially Roze.
At this time. Where all needs
Is his need? what doez that even mean
fo-co-sho-lip-timid, times.
Nah. Nevermore and once more.
Here me again!

*69*

Do you really think that a collection
of 'whodoneits.'
Is going to get anything done.
Roze cannot believe that with every single
problem that plagues the human race.
We have the solutions at hand.
The only thing that stands in the way
is what people, 'our leaders' have chosen
to believe and thats it!
Nothing else matters.
&& that is very much true.
For when sum'one stands up for what
they believe in. Then everyone agrees
with that person
and says, yep, thats what that person
believes.
Then it is repeated and repeated
once again,
until the end of time.
What is this pounding of the nail?
When it comes to problems.
When it comes to senseless death and violence.
It is a choice.
And that choice can be made today.
To end it.
Period.
End of discussion.
Just like gay marriage.
We can marry, men and men and women and women.
Today.
We have that power.
And for the rest of all eternity.
What stands in the way
is 'ideologies.'
Now, Roze will say again and again.
Drugs have existed for thousand of years.
Which means they will always will
in fact exist.
The end game strategy
is to remove narcotics from the
face of the earth and eradicate gangs completely.
These are proven
in fact to be
losing battles.
Your using your time and effort
upon the very forces of nature.
That give us life.
When the solution is staring you rite'
in the face.
The armies of the world fighting wars
is actually
where drugs
were proven to be used for good
and became recreational.

*70*

A whole 'nother
when you get like this.
Times. X Abbreviated. Together.
Than Dots.
Abstract. Where Roze jus' had to say it.
Nevermind no more. When that is a double negative.
But Roze isn't talkin' about Type O
to be exact.
Roze will have to take-it-in.
It speaks to him.
It calls out to him all the while
justifying
the very order of life itself.
What is that order, exactly?
"COOL BLUE JEWELS"
Ya' get it.
Ya.
Its his 2018 wit', DJ AFTERTHOUGHT
Who they are no longer touring with
but he went off to other
bigger, brighter, things
as every artist that he has previously put on disc([]);
is now rather. HYPED UP.
as they say.
And have previously said.
Terribly no more.
Even so.
Roze.

*71*

Thank God this is all that is.
All that I started.
I know that name might be boring.
Boron.
But what have you.
There's cheese.
Shaun, *cough I mean Roze I know you like
your Dairy.
As this is quite the catch you have on your hands.
&& do not worry, have not a worry about the precious little,
Albatross.
Those are sum sea-diving creatures.
O my gosh.
When its dots.
Booze and all of the pillz and stuff in-between.
Like holiday stuffers, quilts and stockin's
When it gets like this do you need another @rolex.
A whole 'nother one.
Or do you wanna take on the weather like Tiger.
Woods, would be better.
No need to tag 'his name.
Everybody already knows about 'him
Have seen him in the tabloids.
Thats rite a golf club.
Here goez your career.
And that is the best Roze can do Today, sorry.
'Til next time, but, but
there might not be a next time.
O MY GOSH.
Here we are.
Popcorn and CCC.
Which stands for, Chicago City Colleges.
Ya get it, @citycollegeschicago.
Yipee!!

*72*

Ohhh, what a jubilee this is.
Is it always commandeering.
This is master-slave mortality.
What does that mean.
Well if a person wasn't suitable for the good life
in the past, they were made into slaves.
However with, "Despotism."
This can be put into place and take place.
For it has, for it did. For all is well.
Roze jus assumed people were good, never thought
they had this in 'em. Nobody did.
And it shares the same model, in Similarity.
What else would Roze, like to say.
Well its strictly off the cuff.
I really like where, π is going.
Is it always so, hypocritical?
Well
why wouldn't it be.
When you have everything on the line, Roze.
When nothin' makes sense.
When your on your last bit of sense.
In every sense and all of the senses.
To a 'T'. Together.
Then make it. Do it. Live it. Succeed.
Follow it, followthrough. You know the way.
The Drill.
Its beautiful, everything that I see.
I cannot compare it to ne'thing else.
Quite frankly.
So here I stare, here I wait.
Once again, to repeat and doover once more.
To never see the light of day.
Again.

*73*

Conclusions.
Equality equals greater times.
More business, more profits.
Through the roof and no-brainers.
But all is that last is what is to come.
Again.
For we are at your full service.
Especially Roze, for he has learned his place.
Truly.
I always wanted before I go, to leave my dent on it.
Roze Means.
The World At Large.
I'm talkin' more than the G8.
Roze is talking about things that take precedence,
things that take more of an urgency to talk about.
At this day and age.
Look at all of our beautiful different
countries,
continents,
states and towns and cities.
What have we done.
Well
We have began to assemble our differences.
'Cause beautiful division to take place.
And now we know eachother better
and ourselves
and in the process.
What this gives us is, this.
Closure.
Harmony.
And once again, Equality.
Money.

*74*

Well
Why dont ya go ahead and take this in.
For nuthin'
Its quite
A 'Dandy.
I said.
It looks like SpiderWebs.
Don't you jus' love spiders, Roze?
What type.
Well.
O Gosh.
Here it goes.
All.
Especially the ones that crunch that go squish.
With your Foot like that Hockey team.
To their very exoskeletons, exposed.
Goo. Slime. Puss.
Hmmm.
That would make them of the trees?
Well.
I just said that!
Wherever they live and such.
If you wanna truly get into it, Roze.
Heard ya before?
Ya where, exactly?
Thru a bitch one time at a bar and in the latest
Magazine.
I'm jus sayin' I've heard the music you like before.
Well.
Metal, isn't that popular Amongst.
However it should be
as you can see Rap
the Hippity Hoppity. Is slowly
inchin'
its way
to its rightful place beside
Rock n' Roll. On public Radio and Our Hearts.
In fact, it already has.
That must mean its good for black people.
Well this is one of their gifts.
That they have brung' to us.
From the 'hoods.
You know.
Roze.

*75*

But How Could
That Be.
Jus How?
I am axin' u. Roze.
Are you asking me or is sumone else there
with you?
At this time.
No.
Well who could you possibly think that it is.
Well.
I can think of one of 2 things.
First and the Second
that is All.
Whatcha mean by all.
Well
I mean every single one of us.
So you don't wanna leave anyone out?
That would be
a good start.
Well.
Don't you want to think about all of us?
Roze.

*76*

Well what do you have here today, Roze?
Congrats.
Before you get into that.
I see that you embody what I despise the most.
A collection of Facts that stand against my stance.
Which in turn
makes it false, you Fool!
What did you jus' call me.
A falsetto.
Clever Clever Clever Clever Clever Clever
ahh' there's another one.
To be removed like a
pin-prick.
But I'm not talkin' about him.
No I would never mention his name.
He has become.
A Mockery.
For however it would be
jus' like that.
That is all.
Roze.
But what
did we jus'
Discuss.
The times.
and
Well.
Your own thoughts.

*77*

Once again.
Congrats.
Is That All.
Well if you wanna take sumthin' home you can.
Let the Women bag it up for you, Roze.
Well I don't necessarily like all of the food we had
to-Offer.
Thas' alright.
We'll jus' bag your favourites.
Then you can keep it in the Refrigerator.
What do you Say?
What else is the refrigerator used for?
TV.
Hell you say.
Is that Real?
I'm gunna axe' you once again
Is Heaven and HELL real?
Like oxy?
Never got in to-'em
Neither that nor the pills.
But I have got into the Dust and the Weed.
And Well.
The Psychedelics Of Course.
Btw.
How many stories do we need to see,
NewsArticles for that matter..
About the therapeutic properties of how these Drugs, those..
Can in fact be used for good and cure Depression Amongst,
Other-Things.
That is what Roze, was pertaining to say.
If you don't-Do Drugs.
It has become so normal with work life and social life and
Everyday Life.
For that matter. Those Matters.
It is seen.
As Weird and Questionable?
And its like Roze didn't have a pair of Full-Grown-Adult
Legs.
What have you. To have..
So its Beyond
peer pressure now and is now proceeded to be
Completely Acceptable. By All.
Furthermore.
You wont impress anybody and trust Roze you wont
make the friends
you want to
by getting belligerent and wasted.
By not going to class and Failing!
Just drop the course and try it once more.
Dont waste your time.
Period.
Roze.

*78*

In a Dying Age.
Isn't it Fun.
Without it.
Humanity Wouldn't Be Reaching New Beginnings.
Again and Again.
The Revolutions.
Our most breast.
Roze, don't you mean.
"Best."
Well.
If you were Truly Lookin' then
Well I guess you would have to Read it once more.
And find it.
Where?
But Where?
Didn't I just tell you, Roze?
What would you mean
By that.
That this is all Figurative and True Reality.
Realities.
Tomb.
Bear.
Some.
Then, What is Left.
But Us Here.
Well.
Here you Go.
And you have to-Repeat it.
Again and Again.
Again.
Religiously and With Repetition and
Then you Begin To Harbor Meditation.
Meditations.
Quite Frankly and Sincerely. With Thought.
Here We Go Again.
O' Really.
What Ride.
Well.
You take your pick.
Well.
I don't like the Ones that make me 'Sick.
But they are liked by others, not me.
So that would put sumthin'
In The Middle.
As
is the Course.
Of intellect. Which is Totality.
Well.
Also the Body and the Soul.
And Without us here.
It would just be a part of Mother Nature.
Like We have seen all Across the Universe and
Neighboring Planets.
Now wouldn't it Be, Roze?

*79*

Whas good?
Huh?
Did you Know Before I did.
Why.
Is it because you got
A Leg up?
Why would you say that, Roze?
Its rather simple.
You go around.
And ask every single person that you see.
Through a Look. Which can find out.
"Do you want children to Die?"
It then becomes Rather obvious.
Those who do
they give this Answer of
Complete Indifference and do not 'Kare.
And its you and not them.
All out of it.
Of sorts.
Then Roze also cruises around to the People
that jus' use people for every device that they can think of.
Filled with gluttonous greed and vicious demonizing.
Dominion.
Of Others.
Now Roze would like to draw the conclusion.
That we all stand in a Form of
'Victimization.'
In the past tense, the here and present
and in the @future.
Leaving no Explanation.
But our own make and desires and our own Will.
Roze.
What you mean what you made of is that you
Ain't me.
Jus' Axin'

*80*

When it Gets Like This.
What did.
God.
It kind of cuts away like sum
Type of Butter-Leaf.
Where Roze is beginning to Understand Dimension.
As that is always the best Understood.
What do you mean Roze?
Well.
I couldn't of said it better myself.
"As they say."
Who says, Roze?
Well.
Not the evil.
But they have many things to say
and take away from us
because they believe that human life and who you can love.
Is nothing.
To them or this World.
Very True.
But how could you find the Sepulchre.
But Roze means sum' kind of a Dumbfounded
form of a whole 'nother Skull
that goez'
with the 'Neverending Day.
and such as.
Where it kind of.
Tapers to your very being
Human body like
sum' kind of plaster,
makeshift.
Otherwise.
We have @lollapalooza in Chicago again this year.
Hometown of many Artists on the Bill.
That we can find interesting.
Are we vicious to others.
Is performing Ill-Will upon Others.
A Ladder?
Can it be a progression to your very Life.
Roze, what Evil do you do?
I honestly believe I dont do any,
Only a Product of 'em and theres alot.
Hidden and Forbidden and Sadistic.
But I could be wrong, I could be doin' sum Evil's I jus'
Don't Know About.
So if sum'one where to draw conclusions on my
'Good and Innocent man' performing his livelihood.
I could learn better.
Once again Roze doesn't knows.

*81*

Seems Ive been Dead O'
For so long.
Could of been a long time I said.
Roze what R u speaking about?
Rigor Mortis.
Is that sum type of creature?
Jus'
Why are you so utterly fascinated?
I could be the one axin'
but that would make you a monumental pattern.
What does that
even
mean.
Well.
With all Life you have the response.
To be known.
And all of the collection of that Nature.
Well
Could you be better then the Others.
Well
Thats why your up there
in Front of Us.
Like sum flame and a Night Sky
And then the Stars cum into Play.
Roze be respectful this is a full-Grown Woman.
I Know.
100% Mexican.
She ain't Playin'.
Never got to meet her tho'.
Thas' too Bad.
I Know
Roze.

*82*

Well
what do u have here, Roze?
I said is it,
Another looking glass.
Do you have what you require.
'Nomenclature.'
There seems to be a Misconception here.
Man
Or R u a women before me.
Well.
Is it for Roze?
What do you mean this piece that you have here,
Today?
Well today is as good as 'ne'other.'
Til' the very last time.
Like, The Shape of the Female.
Who is she?
The one who summoned this Dæmon with me.
You mean one of humanities
most sought after
Human Discoveries?
Is that what you mean,
Roze?

*83*

Here is a collection
of '2 Vaginas'
But it isn't a "Monologue"
or a porn site.
Its on Roze's @instagram ok.
Well.
It is one of the most sought after Desires
of every
single
Man
in this World.
It makes us feel like
we truly accomplished sumthin'
and we have enough Power. Sweet.
To 'house them both.
Ensnared 'dem in a shared Extazee.
Sharing bodily fluids.
Without a second thought nor' Kare.
In this world.
When we R down 'dare.
What
exactly
do u think
that we See?
God.
Once buckle is the times. Ok alright.
Roze hasn't seen one in over six years.
He would like it to be the Shape of the Female's
is that to forward. ➡.
Well.
I have yet to meet her like I have said.
It could be blondie's.
Well.
She tried.
Sadly she isn't the Gateway.
She has another responsibility and represents
sumthin' else entirely.
See how Roze dances around the subject
Instead of jus' sayin' it. To you directly.
Well Damn.
ok.

*84*

When it gets
to tell all.
When well.
I never said.
This one
Again.
All thats their.
Is their.
Cuz.
When it comes time
and it will come time again
Again and
Again.
Here we are.
This place.
Once more.
Drink
to that.
And then once more.
Its all good
got 2 go.
When its goodbye
and such.
And we have no other place
to go
But there is plenty
of places
your just not thinking str8, Roze.
What did u jus' say to me.
I want you out.
No I am not crazy.
This is done.
Ever so done
Now unravel and repel from my
Human Spirit.
Begone with you.
I say.
Roze.
Then date it. August 3, 2022 4:42PM on a Wednesday.

*85*

Well what do you got there.
Could of it been yours.
At sum time.
So that means that everything can be true.
At one time or 'nother.
That would be what is understood.
Is it the common and doez that matta?
What would you say about this Roze.
What could it be?
I ask you this.
What did you even say.
Could it be the very meaning.
Is that what you mean that I'm sayin.
Well it could be either one at this time.
Well that wouldn't be any good now would it?
It could be more or less.
Do you see we have sumthin' in kommon.
Is that what your sayin and is it understood.
Is that now?
How could of it have been mine?
Don't know what could you have done wit it?
I didn't say ne'thing I didn't know.
Thas all I know.
Well that would be off to a good start.
Well
gots to get goin now?
Nah.
I thought I'd stay here a while and turn in.
Take it on back and the like.
Go see the scenery.
Tha' be good.
Roze.

*86*

about little bo peep.
once lived a farm animal.
that was never really put to use.
so it was treated in a similar manner.
then one day it came to having another one around.
then it was all good.
Rite back at ya.
What ya' mean by that.
Are you combative and do u
rise to conclusions in a hysterical manner?
Would that be better able to describe
what exactly we have here Roze?
Wouldn't you know best.
Well I said it once.
I am not going to say it again.
Why don't ya.
Why don't I what r u sayin now?
I'm not sayin' anything at all
Roze.

*87*

well when it comes time for a collection
of doo dads
in your hands
what do you think you got there.
sumthin' strongly tribal
is it hush hush
well dont bring it on by no more.
Roze say it like you mean it.
Wouldn't that be all the way
over to the next sentence
further defeating this ones purpose.
well
if you wanna get clerical like that
sure it does
how about we check
wait Roze didn't say go through
wit it.
then what did u mean to say.
Roze means to speak.
Well
Hold on for a matter of speakin here.
What is it you got.
A taper to the skin.
What could it possibly be
another foreign body unlike my own purity
Roze.

*88*

when you got a speck
there jack
an' whole 'nother one.
Jus' for me.
Well.
It wouldn't be a good time for it.
Never would hurt the ear drums.
But jus' being
and speaking
rather Clearly.
And when you got it all together.
jus' what.
jus' what do you have.
There Roze.
Another conundrum
Well.
Wouldn't that make it into a circle then
when u jus' a sqaure.
And dopey.
Well.
That could be alot to handle
all at one time.
Now Roze has a problem from absolutely none.
To too many. Roze struggles when he thinks
how to best divide up his days.
So his bitches learn their lessons.
Rather savant regard in thus.
Here matey'. To me all. Wander.
Actually I would put this way back even further.
When history has proven everything we need to know
Already.
Roze.

*89*

well when it looks like another dell
in the lock where it belongs
could of been u, could of been me
could of been sum'one else.
All that could be said is already been said
alright well sum'one walk in a full circle
and complete one in order to mock
thats how things get done this is none other
than that extraordinary resounding phrase
it could be even closer to watch me here please
o ever so your more than a man I thought
you could be as well ever so right.
There it is 'rite before my eyes. The seen.
All that is read.
Roze.
Lets pause.
Have a snack.
Then get 'rite back to it.

*90*

Crustaceans.
When your jus' reading this.
And your like whats goin' on!
Whats this about.
Well its about maneuvers and soon to be Desires.
Roze honestly believes work ethic is all you need.
Honestly.
What was that time?
Could it matter less?
Why yes.
Thas' why I got rite back to u in this regard.
As I am the marmalade.
Quite happenin' of you.
What do you mean by that Roze?
Well
it isn't fighting words.
its actually drawing conclusions.
now its like boxing on sum-old-retro-dusty konsole.
Huh' Kinda like that.
@miketyson.
Don't ya jus' wanna watch sumbodie
play a video game in front of u.
Its so entertaining.
Jus' like.
When Iron Mike attached cinder blocks
to ropes
tied 'em around his hands and
started throwin' his mitts around.
Against others.
Professional boxers did not want to fight him.
Forfeit.

*91*

Completions.
Downs.
Ends.
Then Roze proceeds to get into the zone.
Man.
Complete.
Difference.
Similarity.
Forced thoughts and covers.
Frenetic Cross
Overs.
Others.
Ovens.
Obey.
Off.
Ostriches.
Commercials damaging my brain.
Noone is doing anything about it
Termed.
Tough.
Swallow it.
I see
Roze sees now.
Is that ok.
Ya thats fine.
Wouldn't be the last time, now would it?
Thas' good.
All is well.
Tomorrow is a new day. As always.
Carrying on.
Lasting long.
Thas' enough now.
Thas' all you need. Is Gas.
What is that Roze, where'd u get it?
Under the bridge next to the Lake.
Its all over now.
Too bad.
That is. Was over here.
Complete it.
Ok I will, Roze.

*92*

O' know
Here it comes.
What.
Sumthin' that is supposed to be interestin'
and all of that
nonsense.
But Roze, what are u sayin' then.
I don't know,
I don't know anymore
what could it ever be?
O' ever so
no not you again
why would I want you around
this is Roze at full tilt.
The room to grow is getting smaller.
Then what you have here is
this then
A simplification.
Wouldn't it be nice?
If that where true, Roze.

*93*

Well what Roze is going to do.
Whas' that.
Take the best abstract pieces from my collection
Of pieces.
Then incorporate them into 8-10 works of Art.
Further drawing.
The summarizations conclusions.
Dieties.
Where you could have a better idea.
Jus' Who?
U speak.
Roze would spend about a month on a piece.
Maybe 20-30 days is all Roze needs.
Thas' who.
I see.
How so.
Well.
Other than this.
Sum of his art pieces
go perfect on a phone screen.
So you take your pick and wear it on the cover.
You know, the phone background.
Roze isn't talkin the main.
No.
Not that screen.
The resting-idle one.
I see.
Roze sees.
Of course he does.
Hes human after all.
Jus' like us.
You bet.

*94*

So I take a little from there.
A little from here.
To make it look
Alright.
Well, thats mighty fine.
but yet is it a dandy.
I wouldn't say so.
You couldn't be always more so rite.
At times.
When its guts or glory
and its the wrist against the clock
and you have to feel super
in order to go to the market
which is very old in our history
now I am thinking of @civgame or @ageofempiresgame.
Both know how to deal wit' the market.
In game.
Yes, like a vat.
Of.
Been around Shaun or Roze.
Well girls, I mean my bitches like both names.
Seriously.
What is?
O know, Ever so?
Why would you be in my head?
Is it free for anyone to poison with thoughts?
O geez.
I wish their was sum' kind of kure.
Because thats all what I do.
Is I try to achieve the best form
of meditation.
So I can live freely with a free mind.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I think so.
Furthermore.
Geez Roze ur sure draggin' on.
Well.
Its the audience in the darkness sum' I will never know
nor relate to
but I might say hi.
That would be nice.
To do.
To have.
To succeed.
To drive.
To live.
To breed.
To shop.
Once again, at the local grocery.
Bye-Bye.
I'll c ya.

*95*

Ah'
the upload image
to create new post.
Furthermore because it will be seen
isa so excitin'
like clever surfboard Roze.
O' know.
Everlast.
Ever so.
Together as one formulating in my mind.
Which I do believe originally Roze needed in order
to Form his own.
As significant mirrors, crutches, stones.
What have you.
Tables to make me more sincere.
Better able to understand human thinking.
For this is the natural progression of
Sigmund Freud,
Thinking.
That is all.
Is it Roze?
I do believe I have covered all subjects.
Better catch a wave!
Done.
Are u kidding!?

*96*

Now it is time.
As good as ne' other.
Like what you say.
Do what you do.
As long as it ain't near me.
Equivocation.
Surrender, Thunder.
Bias, Age-Groups.
Testicular, Focus.
There is All.
All is Well.
Hercules.
When your spent and it all goes to waste,
When your good and it was meant to last.
Like when the last time that you lifted weights.
I zee.
Don't you mean, see.
Roze, what is it.
I said.
Do you like the new looking glass.
I could 'kare for more
I kould do more
but I no longer care.
So what that make you.
Not lazy for sure.
But what I did last 'nite.
Was a memory to me
Good nite then. Roze.
I didn't say it was or if it wasn't
What is it of concern of yours?
Did I see you there late at night?
Did I see you on the corner of the block, standing.
Did you have to huff and puff.
No.
Then why did you jus' did.
I don't know.
Roze.

*97*

Boy did I walk a long time that night.
I got black out 'krunked, once again.
I didn't know where I was and I woke up in sum' random place.
For Roze likes to do all of the substance abuses.
To draw away from the feelings of the mundane.
There is so much I think that is out there that I have left to do.
You mean.
"Nevermore." Sumthin' Poe said.
He did.
Never sky.
Never body.
Never chalice.
Never walk.
Never scape.
Claustrophobic.
Looking glass.
Hardships.
Been there.
Ah' the ol' Repetator.
The Double Thinking.
The remaining Are You Sure?
The Severe Bland Man.
Forget it Think Again.
is that 'rite.
Thats what I said, Roze.
"To be sure." Sumthin' Kant said.
He was.
I see.
Is it in my subconscious or is it my psychological makeup.
Do these mediums of media feed it to make it worse.
Roze thinks so.
For Roze believes these where originally planted in my mind.
To give me help.
To come to form.
I thank you. Roze thanks you.
I know thas' rite.
In the begotten whore's womb naturally passed down
Through progression.
As the Female gave birth to different evolved humans.
Down the line.
O' Great Spirit help me once more.
For you have guided me all my life.
Give me my freedom.
Let us see where my humanity stands from there.
Stand alone.
Prop.
Digress.
Pent up. All I got.
Thas' better.
Nevermore.
Roze.

*98*

Listen up.
I said what smarts.
Why would you be sayin' that.
Not for any paticular reason.
Gosh.
What was that you wanted to say.
Well to get rite' down to it once more.
This is beginning to take final form.
Feels like a glacier.
Of some sort.
Then molasses.
Yes that could be the best part about all of this.
What is.
The same truth from where ever you would go.
Then find out for me.
Is that all rite'
I would say so.
Then I could be movin' on then.
Ya would you be roze.
I guess you could say that.
Whats there to guess about?
All that I don't know.
But don't ya know most.
Ya I could say that.
Well.
More definitively vindictive.
I would say so.
Now why would their be a would in this.
To help it be more off in its way.
O' alright.
Now your kinda drawin' on.
Its been quite drear.
Is that all you gotta say.
Is this all too much.
Well it could be more simpler.
I don't know anymore.
Well.
Thas' good.
For starters.
All thats there is said and done.
Like I said whats that matter.
Alright once again movin' on now.
I sure hope so.
Why would you say sumthin' like that now.
Where are you goin'
To be sure.

When the lights are on in the room
and you feel all calm
and there is nothin' else to do
but to focus on yourself
a meal
a piece of entertainment that I like
anything would go good with
this calm relaxation of mine
anything.
So thats one off
I feel better for now
and all I got is to rest thinkin'
I sure was good at my desire
which is living as a man.
I did well for myself and there is nothing else I
can do or think about to do for myself.
So I reached a personal culmination where I became
settled as a person.
Very at ease with your life outcomes.
I have successfully planned for the future
to maintain this very position
so I can enjoy these pleasant emotions
once more.
Thats it then roze would go eat sumthin'.

*99*

Evermore the fallout, justify, cant be happening.
Claustrophobic once more, I know it can be daunting.
Never had it but evermore, ever engrossing, do I mean.
That is what is the best present more like it do you say.
I could be more effectual in this common disorder.
Now I jus' got too fancy for you to repeat me.
Although, all together, now would be better than the last.
Was it more than I could take in this regard.
Clasps common traits, ever gold clandestine, quadro-pic.
Biopic of a necessity destiny filled with chosen lust.
Could of been more brash, harsh, demonstrative.
In this regard.
To-ta-lou.

*100*

You know what Roze?
You know what I like about You?
Nothin'.
Exactly rite'.

I see all of the evils done on to me now.
Should I shed the evils done and then move on.
Is tha' the only choice Roze has?
Its seems to be the defense all throughout time.

Wouldn't that be nice.
To know the rite' time at all times.
During the day.
Yes for you have to eat 3 courses.
Work your job.
Live your lifestyle sleep early.
To repeat every day.

I see. Roze sees now.
What do you see.
Nun'ya business.
You have that rite' as well Roze.
There you go.

I didn't have it before.
Now I do and its all messy
and there is nothin' to do else.
Well.

You can go out and make purchases.
Increase your lifestyle.
How about tha'?
Wouldn't tha' be nice.
Now you said tha' twice.
I needed to it seems to be the time
calls for it.

What a lass.
Hope its the best day your going to have and the worst day.
It could very well be.
Thas' all?
Yep that about sums it up.
Then travel and spend more money.

*101*

It holds all together because its frozen.
However you do need to consume it in a timely effort.
Otherwise it would melt all over.
And be A Big Mess.

*102*

Roze has another discipline.
Roze smacked it out.
Roze doesn't know what else to say.
What would you like Roze to say.
Seems Roze has history on his side.

*103*

Could it be more than jus' rite.
I wouldn't never say so myself.
Jus' axin.
Well.
Lest we begin again.
All that is more is never here.
Are you saying your materialistic.
My monetary desires are superficial
in a good way.
I never thought I would be sum'bodie.
Was perfectly fine with bein' a no'bodie.
But times have changed.
The clothes.
The modern touches, to the towns, the cites.
Only offering a wine and dine.
To purchase a commodity.
To vacation with entertainment.
There isn't much available.
Then Roze must venture into the black market.
Dangerous, have to know the rite' person.
And all of that.
That is very good advice.
Why I thank you, what for?
Exactly.
To been had it all, couldn't of been more at a loss.
Cheerio'

*104*

Don't call my name.
All my name is I said.
Couldn't of been more than true.
But all that is last?
What do you mean.
Is it the last of it.
Could it be anymore?
All you draw is circles.
Couldn't of drawn more conclusions.
Because at the time.
There is any left.
I see.
Why thank ya.
Your very welcome.
But does it mean this is the end?
We already had the end.
Roze believes our climax has already come.
That is why he looks from literary to literary.
Not finding a necessary conclusion that I like.
Until I read Shakespeare
now those are endings I like.
Rather finite.
Couldn't of been more true.
Now I like what your sayin.
Theres more to this that I know.
That is why Roze is always lookin'
Always an adventure.
Couldn't be more than contrite.
In order to have the correct conviction.
You must have the correct value.

*105*

I don't know how'd it go?
Do you like @caradelevingne?
Have you ever heard, read Goethe?
Does that go with Faust?
I heard he rhymed poetry with mathematics.
I heard he did quite well.
Have you read Leibniz?
I don't know exactly but I have taken.
Pre-Calc.
Calc 1.
Calc II.
Calc 3.
Differential Equations.
So technically.
I am pretty pleased with myself.
However, TAH, barely scratched the surface.
In my own study.
But I know the essentials, the building blocks.
The groundwork.
The correct foundation.
To build my learning off of.
Wow.
How exciting.
I know.
Roze.

*106*

Roze's 200th example of abstract art.
@instagram if you could increase your margins by 10 pixels.
Enough with the formalities.
For this calls for a...
a varying type of degree.
There it is.
The sea orca quarters.
Why does it smell like orca butt.
I always get this grand, regal
feeling
from entering one of these shows.
It doesn't look humane at all
But that doesn't matter it does jumps
for sardines.
How you hire the trainers you ask?
Why
if you band under the banner of
Human Kruelty towards all and everything.
Then you got the job.
As even the orcas can be sexually chastized.
It seems.
Furthermore.
Lets give it up to the handlers.
My what a hard job they have.
They sure love animals.
The real hard workers truly love the mammals.
To see under the waves.
Their enclosed habitat.
To go downstairs
a couple steps down
and see these magnificent creatures
behind the thick bulletproof glass.
What wonders.
To be hold.
Maybe they have baby.
Sometimes.
I might add.
At your local zoo.
If they have enough money.
Because sometimes zoo's only have several attractions.
They can possibly afford.
That is all.
Willy.

*107*

what would it mean to, right it, in the meantime.
Would this mean it is good.
That we are in a sense all good.
Would it mean you have come this far.
Like lightnin'
Did you jus' describe the weather we shall have.
I know we will, exactly.
I should of taken it this far.
Who.
I know.
When you come to this place in your fruition.
When you are well rested, relaxed, slept.
Could it be more down the road.
There could of been a better way.
But what does that exactly mean.
I'm a good 'girl.'
I know you are.
So let me tell you.
For you already have.
Do you mean to no longer, solidify.
I could of been more 'rite.
In my own 'sacred' terms.
But thats what I chose.
Thats right.
Roze.

*108*

The damage has been done.
Now from this culmination.
Brings this resonance.
How complete.
For now.
They would say that this is enough.
But it never is.
All that is.
Is never complete.
Because we are in konstant suffering.
As this can be seen as a drastic hour.
How complete.
Now that may be sarcastic.
But it never will be, nor hold water.
Why cuz' thats how it is by design.
Like flingin' your entrails at the next
thing that you see.
How macabre.
May that it be.
Whats that even mean now.
You might be backtrackin'
But I only would be a polar bear
who has lost its mind, completely in captivity.
Walkin' backwards and forwards.
In order to be termed that.
Now thank you.
Off to another wine and dine.
For me.
Closure.
All that I said.
Is for now.

*109*

I just contacted Marco.
Things are lookin' on the up.
Today I found out he has a cease and desist letter.
Ready.
When I reached out.
I had these various ideas.
That can be accomplished now with the
various technologies we have.
There goez' that business connection.
However in the sky
it is a different story
then what happens on the ground.
It isn't the first time.
This isn't the first blade of exocommunication.
Nor a crime against humanity
But howabout an act of War?
Would that be better?
More deft.
More complete.
More significant.
What does it matter.
Anymore.
Thas' all.
I don't really wanna take up skateboarding
but I do wanna be able to be good enough
to glide from place to place.
On it.
This could of been a better solve,
Salvation.
I prithee.
Never mind nor say my name.
How could you?
When we jus' got to the fair?
Ferris Wheel.
Concessions.
At hand.
Atlas.
A pun Roze?
Why yes.
Timid. Begone. Shutter. Shudder. Fear.
Happiness.
Been hear all along.
Now that is what I said.

*110*

When I feel
all clastrophobic
and necessarily regal.
I like to take the time to
find out those who are close
to me
and ask the reason why.
Does it look like you will recieve any money.

Now that got dark.
But there always comes a time when I think about
what matters.
And Roze has come to the understand that that
is few and far between.
It is my own personal happiness and my success and my monetary stability.
My love life,
is what matters and then soon my family
Or do you have a family.
I do. I keep it close. Thas good.

For I trusted mine with all of my heart.
As you can see.
The paint came off.
The, 'lie machine' slowed down to a petal and a hum.
Whirring off into the silence.
Never to be used as a mask again. So it isn't unconditional.

This isn't the first time I have been face down.
As I sail on the ship of only the Begotten.
But I have begotten them!
The four whores and the white pea-brain monster.
Now you are the ones who have failed, miserably.
I will say it again, begotten.

Call it those who have a chance to live in this world.
In complete darkness and removed.
Those who have persevered and will continue to
as I trek alone in this world.
I am meant to meet my true loves.
For I still believe it.
You haven't take anything away from me.
Only the grave marks.

*111*

Come on down
Thats what I said.
Come on down.
Come see it.
Movin' it in here.
Thas' all u said, Really?

Ya?
There it was all said and done and complete.
Complete I said.
But what it was before do you remember.

No not much at all
All I could say is that I repeated and it was in my head.
For a period of time
Thas' good. Ya' because I liked it.

Sure did alot.
What does that mean you wanna' go to the whole store.
Where they sell bulk but ya I mean.
Is it on clearance.

That is why you should find the thrift stores
with the correct amount of items that
fit
your particular style.
But that is 'nother story for another time.

We all know your a stickler.
Does ne'bodie else like dancin'?
We have a clear section for anyone who would like to dance.
Over there. Where anyone can join at any age.
Period.
Schools over but not your study.

*112*

Does this look like a Ferris Wheel?
Does it not.
Do's it go with us today, Shirts.
Couldn't of been more plaster.
But you jus' described how to be a construction guy.
There you are with all yo' Tools.
Like its a sport.

But what is this?
Another mouth to breathe.
Another tongue to taste.
Another life to live?
'Rite before u, you say?
I say.

To been more is to divine, live.
Dining in? Yes, 2.
I see.
Where is the rest,
Of you?
This is all that there is.

I see.
I Double See.
Well.
My biological eyes of my organism see. First.
Then my brain does
and no! it ain't dead. But tha' looks like a good movie.
There I just made a suggestion.
Tulip eyes and cherry skates.
Skins.

*113*

Ah'.....the margins. Increased by pixels.
Wunderbar, @instagram.
Because he has good ideas and he's poorer than a seagull.
What is better for all?
But enough of the formalities.
Those.

Is it his last question.
Does this mean these R his last words?
But isn't it.
Am I speakin' in questions but not answers?

Why would that be. Ever so.
Hardships.
Never take more than you can.

It may be.
Had a lot of fun last nite' thanks.
Could of been a better time.

Then Oh'
My
Word.
What happened?
When things become a staging of events.

I meant to say the other word.
Can you not think of it, cannot?
There its all better now.
What.
My boo boo.

Now if you don't make more sense, Roze.
I'm gunna.
Bring what?
Guns terrify me. They spook me.
Because they can do the ultimate thrill.

Roze is sayin' to be on the other side of one.
Has he?
I have never had to stare at a barrel.
I believe in oppression.

I would of lost my mind.
Its so easy.
Made from common chemical compounds.
Everyday.
There is it. All Done.

*114*

What is it.
As err'thang has a natural roll to it.
What is a cod piece.
I heard the gays R in touch wit' it.

Ah' that powerful faction Roze?
Dare I say it.
Everytime I get in touch with my homo-eroticism.
The bitches feel gr8t like their near the beach.

I absolutely love it.
Never mind the 'say so.
What happens is I leave it there.
For a lip?
Nah. But dare I say I wanna throw down
and then when its man to man.
Then I would leave it there

But sadly Roze hasn't been able to set 'up a fair fight
with no (12)-pig-murderers comin' to press charges
or gettin' jumped with weapons by Others.
There it is again, the cymbal.

Whatsa' matter.
The matter is pressing.
The issues are 'naught.
The black women are beautiful dyin' for sum Ivory.
To glitz, to glam their more forward as Roze has learned.
Which is perfectly fine, to Me.

Here's another. I said I did it, I am it.
I am all that is, that I care about.
I am deftly alone, with my bitches and my loved ones.
My offspring as the mother is sacred
Except my begotten Whore.
Ya' know in da' Hood as any one of your favourite Rappers.
Might say.
To tell You.
There it is all done, the 'splaination.
But did I say it 'rong. Grillz me.

Nah its Roze wit' I think is Ever so,
The Bland-Man,
The Double-Thinker,
The 'Did I Get it Rite.'
And I am just too not good'enuff.
And, 'Circles and whimsy and Repetator.'
Ah' the Like.

Les't we come to Form once More.
Now that is good for now.
Once again I said for now until I say sumthin' else.
Thanks Freud.
That is all, Roze thinks.

*115*

Congratulations.
All around.
Here it is.
All is I.
Call it, Art.

At what time do you think
I speak
would it be? Is it?
Whadda' ya call it.
Nevermind. Jeez.

Now all Sad.
But there can't be any difference from Happy, come on.
Come now off to the Lake again see a Seagull.
Like you like.

And have and do those well traveled.
Hello again.
Please enjoy your stay.
In this Regard, once again.
Buffets. Entertainment, people style, and my goodness.
What is This? Nightcaps.

Here is the last one.
Timid once more. Never had any tough.
But all I got. Is I gotta' leave.
I'll be back, Later.

*116*

Ok so here it Goes.
Poop.
O'most forgot and all that I said which
was in my Mind.
There it is all in storage of future memory
Or presumption thinking and resting thought.
Formulative thinking parts of me Brain.

Once again Dead and have risen From An
Eternal Sleep.
Ah' I see. A snow globe I don't even
Know Anymore but what I do know is.
Why so many mundanes.

I mean from time to time jus'
get this grand exasperation.
Might I find It.
There could be added more colour
And a relaxation to it All.
But I said I loved life so
I ever so cherished it
Once more.

Ya ever since my 2 serious suicide attempts.
That issue never came up again.
As it has been rehashed an' people seem to be helping me.
And thats all.

But I never took life for granted once more.
In fact I kinda' loved it before and at the Time.
I was full on ready to end it. Didn't matter.
But now I know better.

So I'm glad that is over ya' about 15 years ago or so.
Didn't take the attempt serious enuff.
Got a gator tear out of it actually and less attention.
Maybe more attention because its sumthin'
that u jus' can't shake.
Ya a stain.

Evermore guided to the direct purpose of my own.
Life can get bleak, dire and downtrodden and I was very distraught
Indeed but I have moved on.
Before that jus' a high schooler then K-7 
which I don't rememba too good.
There thas' All.

Jeez there I go all splainin' myself like to Others.
Never had a definitions to make it into anything.
Substantial.
It isn't tuff to talk about
Jus' a memory of mine to share with other Suicidals I Guess.

But I'm no Longer.
Thas' what I'm tryin' to say.
Jus' took my life to the U-Turn once or twice.
Kissed it Goodbye.
But I crashed from bein' all sheltered.

And heres the thing
when the girl
took the rope
went into her room
to hang herself
my begotten Whore of a Sister.
Felt good'{XX}' about a job well done.
This girl she helped push off with Others
was figuratively in this dresser
and my begotten whore sister
while es'plainin' how it Happened.
thru a morose, Macabre gaze and fixation of her public Death
closed that small top pantie drawer.
For good.
Then moved on and had dinner out to eat.
High school can get dark these days.
So if your emotionally pummeled
then you have it comin'
through indifference, whats wrong with u, suicidal thoughts are disgusting
