# All-of-my-archived-Twitter-Data
* I have successfully migrated all of my twitter Data, Date generated: May 12, 2022 at 5:49:04PM.
* What this is, is an interactive HTML.
* Where I can see all of my abstrack artwork && my fashion showcases which I do not. I repeat do not want them to be stolen.
* I can see all of my tweets which I started since mid' January.
* Now in order to get all of my tweets in a text document that remains to be seen. I have yet to see where this hitml pulls my tweets from, 
  looks like a javascript. The images are saved in the folder, 'tweet_media'
* Sum of the images did not copy over correctly. Its interesting how it started as 1.1 GB however I chopped this baby down to 33 MBs.
  You know why its because it includes all of the worlds countries emojis && a giant list of other ambiguous icons.
