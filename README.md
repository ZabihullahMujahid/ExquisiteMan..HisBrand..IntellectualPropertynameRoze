# ControlSpace'
* I have done 2 years of work.
For I modeled this after all of the People Nation, music property Heroes && Insignias.
To further education, spark interest, drive profits in business.
It is a entrepreneurial business concept.
Where I am currently using my art, Abstract. My fashion sense, from my music && finally my
Poetry to better describe my feelings && emotions. Its also a personality of sorts && author
What this does is make an intellectual into an artist. Promoting only good throughout the
community, amongst fellow artists && the like.
To help business,
create business && then
finally completing business
&& showcasing business && speaking about businesses on Youtube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, NEIU, CCC.


Exquisite Man && His Brand Intellectual Property: name roze(Ben Zariatnatmik)aka THE OMNiPOTENT OWL â™¾ðŸ¦‰

The concept is as follows.

* 2 Intellectual Property Heroes && Insignias in a room thinking outside the box.
For an educational podcast about what drives excitement around or infomerriational
Could be about your 'local && corporate businesses && conglomerates && friendly personnel.'
You have your makeshift tasks && each Hero has their own speak sheets.
You cover what you need to say about business && complete business && that means you have informed the 
listeners various things they need to know.
Then I && the other hero will discuss what is happening in the
community in terms of 'entertainment, eating, housing || auto'
Then get into what you like either music || sport || dining.
I bring up the business I've been working on. The other insignia shows you their business.
You exchange like I said, talking points.
Discuss the fields of thought && see if I can further education.
Put your artwork up there.
Then share artwork && thoughts about todays business && anything business that businesses would like to be spoken.
The concept is here.
A man || women, an idea, networth && ideas && talking points.
The business, any startup && business offerings && all sponsorships.
Then mostly likely of all || any starpower do you have it && got it. Hold on to it.

* Concerning this business entrepreneurial concept.
If you succeed in your Art then your going places.
If your Art passes a significant bar.
As you can tell with mine.
Then Roze will succeed in business && as an intellectual.
This needs to be a 20-30 @YouTube with another insignia.
Then your really bangin' on all cylinders.
Roze brings his applications in development to show.
Roze has his sponsorships && his business partners.
Roze begins to advertise, market, promote that business.
Roze talks about interesting thoughts with the other insignia.
Roze ties this into either his abstract art || fashion design.
The other insignia takes its turn.
Roze trades thoughts about what is at hand.
Roze talks about local opportunities, wine && dine, news.
Roze wraps it up into a 20-30 min package.
The viewer has many things to go over.

* So you have an entrepreneur with his choice of art to share, there is various businesses && projects he is working on, 
he can forward exploratory education, he can market anything on topic, complete business, talk about the business community, 
schedule business deals, promote.

* I have successfully migrated all of my twitter Data && now have salvaged my Twitter account completely, date generated: May 12, 2022
* What this is, is an interactive HTML.
* Where I can see all of my abstrack artwork && my fashion showcases which I do not. I repeat do not want them to be stolen.
* I can see all of my tweets which I started since mid' January.
* Now in order to get all of my tweets in a text document that remains to be seen. I have yet to see where this html pulls my tweets from, 
  looks like a javascript. The images are saved in the folder, 'tweet_media'
* Sum of the images did not copy over correctly. Its interesting how it started as 1.1 GB however I chopped this baby down to 49.7 MB's.
  You know why its because it includes all of the worlds countries emojis && a giant list of other ambiguous icons.
* just uploaded more of the images saved with the correct 'taglines.' 'correct image filename calls' A couple of them are still missing. Most, 89.48% is there.
* This archive does not show my threads I have written, nor my replies && I mean to say when I get into areas. My wikipedias neither. This is of concern.
* The tweets are stored in data/tweet.js grabs them from a very long json. No way to log each individual tweets into a book of sorts at this time. 
Further getting into it, the individual tweet 'Replies, the threads' are under the Replies [Tab] so it isnt a total loss, my tweets are there. 
But still I would like for it to be clearly && cleanly organized as the real-time web application. This separates my threads however when I use Twitter it does not. 
Why this is. Is a problem. This is still considered a bug.
* They have now restricted my twitter account && I just tried to create a new one && I had to go thru the same verification process. I dont have a phone #! I am homeless && peniless. 
I'm guessin this will last for about 14-20 days until Twitter proceeds to give mercy && you can logIn again. 
* Luckily I saved everything just in the 'knick of time.
* If your looking to make yourself into 1, an Intellectual Property Hero && Insignia than you only need to jump from ['tab to tab'] && follow the same dates.
* Because my twitter account has become temporarily restricted at this time because Twitter does not know if I am a robot || a person.
