# All-of-my-archived-Twitter-Data
* I have successfully migrated all of my twitter Data && now have salvaged my Twitter account completely, Date generated: May 12, 2022 at 5:49:04PM.
* What this is, is an interactive HTML.
* Where I can see all of my abstrack artwork && my fashion showcases which I do not. I repeat do not want them to be stolen.
* I can see all of my tweets which I started since mid' January.
* Now in order to get all of my tweets in a text document that remains to be seen. I have yet to see where this html pulls my tweets from, 
  looks like a javascript. The images are saved in the folder, 'tweet_media'
* Sum of the images did not copy over correctly. Its interesting how it started as 1.1 GB however I chopped this baby down to 49.7 MB's.
  You know why its because it includes all of the worlds countries emojis && a giant list of other ambiguous icons.
* just uploaded more of the images saved with the correct 'taglines.' 'correct image filename calls' A couple of them are still missing. Most, 89.48% is there.
* This archive does not show my threads I have written, nor my replies && I mean to say when I get into areas. My wikipedias neither. This is of concern.
* The tweets are stored in data/tweet.js grabs them from a very long json. No way to log each individual tweets into a book of sorts at this time. Further getting into it, the individual tweet 'Replies, the threads' are under the Replies [Tab] so it isnt a total loss, my tweets are there. But still I would like for it to be clearly && cleanly organized as the real-time web application. This separates my threads however when I use Twitter it does not. Why this is. Is a problem. This is still considered a bug.
* They have now restricted my twitter account && I just tried to create a new one && I had to go thru the same verification process. I dont have a phone #! I am homeless && peniless. I'm guessin this will last for about 14-20 days until Twitter proceeds to give mercy && you can logIn again. 
* Luckily I saved everything just in the 'knick of time.
* If your looking to make yourself into 1, an Intellectual Property Hero && Insignia than you only need to jump from ['tab to tab'] && follow the same dates.
* Because my twitter account has become temporarily restricted at this time because Twitter does not know if I am a robot || a person.
* [Twitter] "https://twitter.com/Air_3_14" This account has now been permanently suspended.
