• I would like to discuss the silver platter and different ways to take this. @Chase @POTUS45 @BHHSRealEstate. 
• When it comes to the economy it all represents the bottomline so doesn't that mean there is always an answer. 
• One way to look at capitalism is to drive profits and more profits, monetize anything that you can think of. 
• I was thinkin' with @KingJames the other day and not only is this profit coming off direct interaction but also profit 
  can rain in from the indirect, representation of the fact that an entity is a legacy and unchangeable. 
• Further branchin' off, Wall Street @WSJ is all about profiting off ingenuity, ideas and what you bring to the table. 
  Howabout profiting off of, the term, "Girl Power." Wouldn't that be neat.
• I can only think of terms, indirectlly or refering to there lasting power, as any company tries to build a legacy and some will succesfully
  be around for a very long time, lasting past the lifetimes of their CEO's. Now its similar to NFTs and how the image represents the overall
  idea, the economical representation. As you can take any name brand and apply it in a imaginative world, a figurative world, a dream world
  where it takes on different purposes. Further meaning blending well-known names with well-known companies that are good to the public.
  The meaning of the long-lasting appeal of a company's image and what it stands for the public taking on a more interactive display.
• One more thing while I have you anything that doesn't sell anything is gold(Au). 
• Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. 
• I have one more. This is written in the company mission statement. If I am any kind of employee from the store to the office board 
  member what can happen is this. I take in and embody the company to my best ability and I am low on the totem pole but at times 
  I can be the CEO and get things done. 
• What this business entrepreneurial concept is meant to do is venture out to any field or professionalism that we can 
  possibly think of and inquire how our systems our representing us and if they are in fact doing their job for us all. 
  Education and law enforcement need this. 
• @GMC. 
• I want you to begin to think of a world where anything can in fact be sold and if it can be, it is considered a possession. 
  Let us achieve a collective vindication. Its all of our goods, everythings a goodie. Its the economy, black market, the real 
  actual market you see before you and anything that you can think of, desire or may think of when it comes time.
• No competition is needed between companies for the fight of profits only the beneficial income of the parlay is of necessity, commodity.
• When it comes down to the same. If a company where to organize itself, offer its public offerings, commodites and services exactly so   
  and just like other companies that are in the same position this new company would like to commandeer then what happens is this.
  You lay down the architecture of this company the same way the others are ordered and laid out. Then these companies rely on the 
  purchaser, buyer and guest choices. Further meaning it will result in a personal specificity which is the choice of the happy-giving-money-holder.
• Then take, which of what thy has of all is which is yet to be ours, once again all. Then is thy that have'it for it was once attached to others. eth. banks.
