So going thru the store. What do you find, I mean myself. Find, I. WHat or where do I look to then look sumo'? Forit. The calm relief of finding it so. I usually 
only have less than a 100 dollars to spend at one time. Never have I ever'gone to there. To make a big purchase that requires trucks to deliver it to you. But that can 
be done, I am told. Say for instance a big piece of furniture beit a desk, a chair or a loveseat. The demand has been met. The demand was there, it was supplied to the 
public. Anything can be bought for a good price. This is what this place is known for. Continuing on. I usually see who is on the cover of magazines. I like to walk 
through to see all of the food, offered. I see the latest and greatest, Toys. I might even have time to stop at the electronics and try-out the latest gaming system. 
Then the snacks and candies. And all of the cold drinks that are availabe. I then make my purchase and make my exit. @Walmart

So its more than just giving water to the ground. These are essentials. These are the very same crops that the human race survives off of. Because we are no longer
fending for ourselves, we have mechanized this process. And various other processes that once successfully irrigated it moves onto the next objective and eventually 
to your families table. The biggest leasson is the machinary attached to this: as I have seen it at work. Some spots get drenched, as you have seen, leaving other 
spots only given a mist. So that has to be correctly diametered; in order to have water equally distributed to all other available areas. And what other form of 
irrigation can you possibly'Think'of other than farms and crops8? The shower. Even a new sprinkler system that has been recently constructed on Dusable Lake Shore Dr. 
to water the plants and flowers during only the warm seasons because it gets frozen otherwise. Even some of the produce that is offered in stores. You have this 
miniature irrigation system in that window or even companies, housing plants and food:ew?s8uet:ou?78*9(0re: The reason being, is that you can replenish what at
