Now what is told what is gott and what is had and what is the matter
wit that premise between the proposition and its the end of the night
might as well have as many shot of this brand Roze likes to say outloud
because hes Irish and feels white and Irish while slippin' it on back
behind his gullet and skull cavaties. There it is another reason to feel
like a man while drinking. @jamesonwhisky.

Heres his name popping up and out of the picture and inside of the frame
once more, double-vision. the mathematician is looking at a specific 
representation of the line, which is the function which is then drawn by
example in a graph which is a selection of numbers and its surrounding shapes
giving a mathematical meaning to the points and shapes of the mathematical
determination. The mathmatician then can posit the exact place, of these 
selected planes, in the mathematical sample chosen given by the points of meaning
to the line at this time. The graph is usually the roots and general 
approximation and standard model at hand. With this definition an entire
world of mathematics would be resounded on this basis of laws, numbers and
signs. As any mathematical bodie can give meaning at any point in any time. 
Then what would be the mathematical representation of these foreseen effects
as the causes are lead by mathematical solutions. How can one organize such a
bodie of information at one time or to be saved in order to draw mathematical 
comparisons the next time. Then the mathematician can designate this bodie
for other scientific purposes leading to other interpretations that are necessary.
