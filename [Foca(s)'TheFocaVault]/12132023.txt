Thats what its coming out like::(/)0"' Isaidwhat' More:;"' Come here--f☐:;"'-/M thenameofthegame' itis' called I said I wanted to have one and
youwillhaveone' and enjoy this delicacy and apparently its a play off of sugar' That it reminds you of the solidarity of ethnicity and the demonstration
that you is, what are made'of. whatRoze' is trying to get it down to as it is a difficult nut to crack, deliberate this just so happens to bring each and
everyone's nationality onout' and in such a decorative way and that is so nice to see and then share-experience all that fulfills us as the Peoples of this
common World that we do show and do you dare. So you feel good, as a sweet does to you. About yourself, you feel very comfortable in your own skin and then such.
Because you enjoy the make of you, as a person, as a creed, as a certain ethnicity and then begin to assimilate into your very own making. Not touch my commanderistries
upon thee' and all the namestay's that you have begun to bound and come to thy'hand and then eatoncemore'. So again you find that solidarity amongst the Peoples.
Because we are very solitary but also find divine social skills that make us and together as one hold a better frame together. The frame being the very existence
that you are, amongst your own making and creed your ethnicity and then from their your are more fully enveloped into your world be it in a spiritual manner or a
physical one. Leaving that aside and that being said. It also represents complete human freedom amongst many. So again, you achieve this lone tranquil solidarity and
we were just talking about Marzipan at first.

actually believes and without any motion-sickness nor walking into things or bumping into things. To completely lose yourself to the fantasy, the gaming fantasy.
As this is God of War, and the series. So we have digital immerision, artist boards transitioning to complete able to video-game-playstation through different kinds of
