I don't think so, what a direction. And that album cover, God do I love his harmony, his happiness seen onit. How free he was 
to explore another genre and then David got into the 90s. When it was o' so gosh darn obvious. Ever heard of that expression? "Bleed Thru." 
The point is to understnad the turning points of when our existence takes place in a common setting with everything around us? Albiet.
