The first thing that came to my mind was that essential. That earthquake. That
quiet calm that everything is alright and sound in your life and our collective
lives as a whole going perfect with a treat, a snack, a bowl of your favourite 
cereal and a desert of your choosing. No matter the time of the day or at night
this drink is perfect for you and your setting. Now at your local grocery store,
like @jewelosco and you can buy organic which just means cleaner ingredients and
the company doesn't torture the animals making this. You have the @Horizon_Organic,
the O Organic, I just get the store brand 2 gallon because I love my milk 
drinking @jewelosco brand, and then the well known @Oberweis glass recycle 
offering.

What is it that we do? Where is it that we take place in a variety of common human senses that we
have come to learn and able to discern. Dasein. "Tobacular, statehood, mystify." "To grok." We have
this communication with our planet only through our organisms but it has been on grand demonstration
before with our literature and now geo-political stances and powers. What do we have in common with
our ancestral planet in a chemistry, biological and physical relationship. Very many things but at
the same time not many things to name or think there of. When I think of this scientific system that
is the expression of Nature in this dimension. Way up in the sky. Roze would love to understand our
exosphere, thermosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere and finally our troposphere in a better unique way.
Meaning who do these layers play off eachother when it pertains to our human understood physics and
what is the certain balance that these layers show us. What does that mean to us and what can it bring
to us, more understanding of something that we do not control and like everything in nature is only,
"There," and we come into contact with it, touch it, feed off it and derive our necessary human
survival. @NASA.
