[/M] So that wouldn't happened to be but wouldn't you be mad about it. This happens to be another way to tell time? Now what is time and in what sense is it to compared to that is all. All. Like it is and like so. But how does that compare to us and the natural graphs and then like Heidegger has said, you would find an elucidation so particular that it would draw these necessary conclusions.

Does it always fit under cause and effect. Andbtw' is everything a science and is everything can it be factored down into a science.
