Congratulations. So no more so. I loved the grease. I took it. I said I took a napkin to its ass. For it passed. Me by. And I didn't wanna go without I 
might get a cheeseburger, curly fries, 2 chosen tacos and a slice. I might call it mayday. There. That is all and what is spent. Is so joust. There it 
would be the remaning remnants of my platter. Once again. The tray. the..napikans. And the rest, whatever is left, of the dark soda. I usually go with the 
root beer. And all is well. I say so to myself. Thank you New York for coming, bringing it on, to @Chicago. Thanks so much. I can't wait till I dine'again.

So I was walking on down the line. And I had Miss'May. All with me and surely I said to myself, this is a good quarter. Let it be the day. That I have 
on'done'it to meself? And then once again the memory. As we are moving slowly everly fastly but once again surely down on down and up to me? For I was the 
last man standing. It seemed and the worth to it. The box of your worth, to it. I said. And the remaining nomenclature. No worths. No amounts. Same as time. 
Forit held gold and now its gone! O'dearly beloved. We are here, to grieve. Yes I said follow the sorrow and you will find the true answer to one's storie!
