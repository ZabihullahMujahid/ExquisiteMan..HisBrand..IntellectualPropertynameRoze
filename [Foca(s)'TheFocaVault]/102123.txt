But how does the human race, exactly know how to keep the best time? When everything is set, because orignally we chose to model time after the sun and the setting sun and how the moon plays off of that as well then we moved into each and every season to see how time takes place. Now is that good enough?--f:;/"With everything factored in after that research of how time takes place and then the reproduction of that time taking place playing out before you in a time sphere, say from Chicago to New York to Los Angelos to even sum'of the cities that you would find so fascinating, that you would begin to realize the different times? So that is why then you have different types of technological patterns and even different types of chemical compositions[:;'"?/how does a time piece react to the natural world as we watch it turn its heads or even its digital numerals right before us as we wake and lie down and take the time--into'us:;"'?/tonameafewexamples:;"'?/>.

With every generation and generation> I love it. Ok. I can't wait to play it. Can we properly tell the future> Set my handsonit'. Sum of us people, have to wait until are friends who are more "monetary stable" in order to playit' I also am at a loss, because playing new kinds of systems are no-longer a thing of the past? I mean to walk into a store and not be able to play the latest console in @Walmart or in a @Target or in a @MircoCenter, mind you, once again to not be able to? That is now what it looks like to be in the done since past?? And the Arcades are gone, or sum are still on-up these days and some arcades still around for the parents or for the young children looking for a place to play the video games, that are fun for one and all still to this day showcase visual and physical upgrades. That this would be a place to showcase the best that we have alongside the new systems, then perhaps a customer would buy one> And when a person thinks of buying one it comes down only to:;"':;?/<,.@:;"'.:;"'?/@Nintendo, @Xbox those 3 and what @GabeNewell and @Steam are doing these days/ So handheld is the way--console is the way and then finally the arcade-is-the-way asitis' still'kickin'" does anyone here want to goto an accomplished and well-thought out and not-so-very busy lookin' with sum girls around and play some arcade games with a friendly non-intrusive staff and great food perhaps? Don't just it look good? Now I speak of the latest iteration of the Playstation. It looks so good, it does, that I can't once again wait to play-it-station(*09):0; Its a good online experience its immersive if I have learned anything from the likes of @Sony @Playstation compared to the other system offerings and in this latest generation, that is currently offering to us. With househould names meaning the long-standing video-game-series in this place and offering as I have said. Virtual reality means it is all that can be seen, it means your lost into a complete creation of a video-game world. The classic "DualSense" wireless controller has touch-pads so you can express your video-game existence in this way and that way and have better control when you need to slide your hand over rather than press or hold any of the other buttons and joysticks. Then we have the "HD Camera" which immerses the outside world with your digital world, marrying the two into more of an immersive experience, once again.@Playstation.
