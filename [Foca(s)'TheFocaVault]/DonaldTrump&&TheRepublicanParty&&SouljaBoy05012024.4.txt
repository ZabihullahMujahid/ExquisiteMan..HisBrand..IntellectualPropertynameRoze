The way he set the Republican Party straight. The only candidate they have.
How he is a businessman first and family man overall.

The Republican Party is the answer in comparison to the other choice.
--when this is administered their is only one way. And that is to understand its either Republican or nothing//
  So you only have one way to understand legeslation, to understand the political ""dia-morphism""/?'"" and to understand what it takes for these bills to pass or what needs to be "Republican
  trimmed" And thats all. Anything democrat isn't republican and thats the truth but they are always open to these solutions. Don't you see these solutions perhaps Republican Democrat but
  at the end of the day, we have voter's'voters*809 that only'Only vote Republican, out of safety for them and their families. With this "wheelin and dealin"

  families so hard fought. This is Congress. Get things done? Do anyone of you have any spine. And now the democrates are centrist and the Republicans are wheelin and dealin' centrists of the
  Democrat kind. So its the same apple. The same tree.

Very down to the point. This brand and musical property hero and insignia is. I have only listened to
a couple of his albums and seen some of his videos. Your getting one of your favorite shows your going to
see as you have waited and you will then be treated. To the music video soon ending. The formula your getting to
make money is in its simplicity. It seems that if you continue to lay oar in this manner and you see no returns.
You will soon down the line see that same oar tried and true. Perhaps take a turn to the left and see the summer'oar.
See that pay date and your spiritually rewarded in such a regard, that it can't be harbor or nor close to be true. That 
same oar. Where you spelled it. Your also getting the fashion, Shaun. Wear this around and you can look like a snoo-buuse::se'
Just waiting around with my snook'emloccker'combonavigation'time'locker. Said Shaun. Where else can you wear something
like this and what did you see some black hit'ya'hat and it goes off all the time and their is no more need for it or mine.
Where is this going. Much worth my time. I thank you sir and I do appreciate the combo meal style complete package meaning 
your presentation was like opening a box of Jordans for the first time. Livin' as a gangmember you have your life on the line
everyday. Then as a cop you would have a better chance. Armed forces you have a 50/50 shot of making it back. I never wanted
to live any of those three choices. I decided to lay low and take on the protection wing of support to help decrease violence to
anyone at anytime. Black history is one of the gravest darkest subjects of study you will ever see or read for that matter.
