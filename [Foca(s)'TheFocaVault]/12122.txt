So I said the flautas. And I tried them a couple times, no pleezy. No breezy. But I said to myself, everything on the mexican menu should be in my belly. 
I said this to myself, and I say it again and again. The Horchata, this rice water, sweet creme. How do you make it and keep it fountain'd. Then I sat down, 
and its in between other offerings, a @7elven's nearby, God damnit! And I thought to myself, I go with the usual because they don't offer a complete nacho plate, 
persay. So I get the stk burritos and stk tacos and chips and salsa on the side, extra cheese. Same thing. haha. So I had myself a time, usually when it says #5 
there is other locations in the city and this family recipe is and has been successful.

"So I took a look'at'it. I said there it was, there I was and all. There go. There I was. There I was stand't. Stand Man? More like. It. Then it was all that was 
there before. Look'sy. There it was once more and again. Like a coalesce. And your coalecsing and your drama making more of it. For the time. And necessary, 
the pace." @chipublib.

So require. Require. and require once more. That is how this first started. This arm. This strange macabre operatic pharmaceutical "medical" arm. That can be 
dangerous as err'bodie knows you can die like Jesus of the music scene. And he had a skin condition and was an advocate of plastic surgery. Now reincarnated and 
his family is doing well, at least from what I can see. At least the audience, can. To be exactly for the patient. and tailored to. Its exact sickness, 
terminal illnesss, medical condition to its best therapeutic ability and that is to be chemically compounded and scientifically researched and made for this specific, 
syndromn. There. In there and the more you are prescribed the more of its potency will be expressed within your bodie. @JNJNews
