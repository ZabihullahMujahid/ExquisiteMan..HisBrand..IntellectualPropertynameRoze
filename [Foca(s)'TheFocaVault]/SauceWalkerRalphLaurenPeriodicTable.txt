I think he is bringing a "New York Style"" out of Houston, Texas. where he is from and birthed.
Houston has a big name in rap.
Beenatitsince'((Years active	2007–present))
Imahopskipandthenajumpathim'The thing about havin'beef is that their is this otherside to the beef. Now I don't have any beef 
with anyone. Roze aside. Its meant to bring out your true colour and create room for other beasts and creatures and big men
that want only one thing, glory and space. Artectual space. Artistry. Now that their is a beef its set for life, and he just
made a freestyle to one of his songs from one of his latest. Where does the critique draw water and where does it not "hold
any water," the conquest leading to glory is perfection. It can be done, we have seen it take place. The rap game is also
about various work-ethics. You can lay your success on that. Very hard tried and true that old thing was the name of the game.
Here we have another music property hero and insignia and he looks to be holding on to whatever makes him famous or gets his 
name out there and done and so he can secure money from the shows or be seen at a famous music venue where people would pay
their dollar for his music show and they would see his collective that has the similar names ""Sauce"" --e'
Its also based off of talent level.
I think the talent is there. Now its all about building a fan base you see all the work he has done to get to this point.
Thats talent talent is long-lasting appeal. Talent says this guy should do rapping for money and go get more money elsewhere rapping.
He has shown you the countless racks that he has gained from rapping he has to hold them in two hands. Its impressive to make all
that money just rapping. That is why you continue to watch it and perhaps he can make more racks rapping.
Concert going has changedthese days your either in the "box" or at the Arena'ss. So who were to judge for success? Success-making. I know I am 
excited for next 'Extend Play' his dis(c) and retributive (Coll)ective. I'm gonna' spin it like I did 'Dat Boy Den' and I will
recieve the better nostril of protection, of the HumanKind, and the significant flavour coming from his hometown, Houston.
He has everything you need in an act. I have never seen someone work this hard for a bite. This coming and going. a. His name
is well-known. His music property hero and insignia is a success. His latest album is enough to push him across and into the rap game.
Some rappers have staid on the side for a long time other rappers are from the very start and they go straight to the top but what is 
the top any'mo. This is legitamite. He needs to understand his position. He is looking at the small venues with his collective under the
same namel, Sauce. He could fill the medium to large venues. Other than that its into the arenas but that is only the top acts. The acts
that can sell arenas. Their is only a limited few acts that can sell an arena amount of tickets. So he has the position to come out a
very respectable name and respected Artist and be seasoned and touring well with anything that he can get. I think he is going to be around
the reason I say this is because their is always no never any job security and he can be out of it as much as he can get into it. Everyone
here knows just knows how much much much much work you have to do in order to get on a bill and tour around. Music property heroes and insignia's
make all of their money with a couple online spins of their materials, the added pluses are that they tour all over the country bringing in the
name of all these great rap acts, some of all time, some only starting out and some touring the same way Sauce Walka is. Online is a better
connection with fans, the fanbase, at one time and you can go out to tour. Like he is. Then who here wants to pay two rims and a dandy'elion. 
To what is the greater faith, much later, thank you fanbase, your going to remember then it was the last time that you forget that.


I think the biggest'thing is that you look presentable and accustommed/:eO0')""-:-;?///(m)cmmc>M.os:-;?"-'?/'
Yet at your leisure, but this is very serious a business man or woman ready or have grown accustommed to the fact
that your someone to count-on. Varying types of professional-like business attire and yet at the same time, when your
feeling rugal. Which means your ready to talk pelican or are going to talk in pelican. And then usually this follows with'it
and that.

this! Ralph Lauren ** rather than the other companies, in comparison. So what I like about it so is just how it maintains a casual premise
of the holiday festivities along with those same garments you have any form you would like. Rather easily attainable. Last winter I had
a soft flannel(red) jacket that I know was originally pricey at retail it still is that way to me eventhough second hand or if you find 
yourself at any department store. That when we wear this we feel this way now.<,.>Os.>z:-_?/;<,(PP).>
