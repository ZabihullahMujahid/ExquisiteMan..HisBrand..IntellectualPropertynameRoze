I think he is bringing a "New York Style"" out of Houston, Texas. where he is from and birthed.
Houston has a big name in rap.

Imahopskipandthenajumpathim'The thing about havin'beef is that their is this otherside to the beef. Now I don't have any beef 
with anyone. Roze aside. Its meant to bring out your true colour and create room for other beasts and creatures and big men
that want only one thing, glory and space. Artectual space. Artistry. Now that their is a beef its set for life, and he just
made a freestyle to one of his songs from one of his latest. Where does the critique draw water and where does it not "hold
any water," the conquest leading to glory is perfection. It can be done, we have seen it take place. The rap game is also
about various work-ethics. You can lay your success on that. Very hard tried and true that old thing was the name of the game.
Here we have another music property hero and insignia and he looks to be holding on to whatever makes him famous or gets his 
name out there and done and so he can secure money from the shows or be seen at a famous music venue where people would pay
their dollar for his music show and they would see his collective that has the similar names ""Sauce"" --e'

Its also based off of talent level.
I think the talent is there. Now its all about building a fan base you see all the work he has done to get to this point.
Thats talent talent is long-lasting appeal. Talent says this guy should do rapping for money and go get more money elsewhere rapping.
He has shown you the countless racks that he has gained from rapping he has to hold them in two hands. Its impressive to make all
that money just rapping. That is why you continue to watch it and perhaps he can make more racks rapping.

Concert going has changedthese days your either in the "box" or at the Arena'ss. So who were to judge for success? Success-making. I know I am 
excited for next 'Extend Play' his dis(c) and retributive (Coll)ective. I'm gonna' spin it like I did 'Dat Boy Den' and I will
recieve the better nostril of protection, of the HumanKind, and the significant flavour coming from his hometown, Houston.


I think the biggest'thing is that you look presentable and accustommed/:eO0')""-:-;?///(m)cmmc>M.os:-;?"-'?/'
Yet at your leisure, but this is very serious a business man or woman ready or have grown accustommed to the fact
that your someone to count-on. Varying types of professional-like business attire and yet at the same time, when your
feeling rugal. Which means your ready to talk pelican or are going to talk in pelican. And then usually this follows with'it
and that.
