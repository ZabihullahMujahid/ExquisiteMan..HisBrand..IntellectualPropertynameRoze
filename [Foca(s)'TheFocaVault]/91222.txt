Couldn't of been more better of a decision in this regards. As in any regard and in fact that term is quite fancy. Yet to be in regards to. So there you have it the status symbol and all. Where you can have it if you can afford it and then band together under different nationalities and ethnicities and let those differences shine on through. This is all we are trying to do and also notice the social hiearchies and different wealth groups for each and every American boy and Man.@RalphLauren.

"Don't call my name.
All my name is I said.
Couldn't of been more than true.
But all that is last?

What do you mean.
Is it the last of it.
Could it be anymore?
All you draw is circles.

Couldn't of drawn more conclusions.
Because at the time.
There is any left.
I see.

Why thank ya.
Your very welcome.
But does it mean this is the end?
We already had the end.

Roze believes our climax has already come.
That is why he looks from literary to literary.
Not finding a necessary conclusion that I like.
Until I read Shakespeare

Now those are endings I like.
Rather finite.
Couldn't of been more true.
Now I like what your sayin.

Theres more to this that I know.
That is why Roze is always lookin'
Always an adventure.
Couldn't be more than contrite.

In order to have the correct conviction.
You must have the correct value."


What this means is that there is many ways to say Clandestine and when it comes to the illegal immigrants sometimes as we all know that these immigrants that come from the south of the border are very hard workers and they usually work two different jobs to put their children through our schools. @ICEgov and its subsidaries are the very definition of pig forces and internment camps and illegally removing the rights of immigrants and jailing them for misunderstandings. This special interest is extremely dangerous and you must avoid it at all costs. As with every immigrant that knows how to avoid the pigs and just simply go around the issues and maintain and aquire citizenship or visas through different means that won't jail your families because you want to work in the United States. @DHSgov is where all this criminality takes place under the guise of doing good, protecting the American People but what this place is really doing is criminalizing anything and everything that stands againsts or stands up or stands in the way of Homeland Security and this United States subsidiary is making sure that everything looks good on paper and then no questions will be asked and it will look very dutiely and very sound within the confines of Law and Justificaiton. I just described a Clandestine operation.
