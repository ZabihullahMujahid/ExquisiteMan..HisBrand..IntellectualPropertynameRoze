The Obama Foundation has now begun its destiny post-Obama-Presidency where in Chicago, Il you will see a Presidential Library built in commeration
of this successful presidency. That Barack Obama once had. Now referred to as a former USA President and still if not the most powerful leader the
world has. Still and until his natural public death. He is a workhorse like everyone else. We see the American people put their noses to their
personal grindstones everyday to get by. Its either manual labor or career work. Their comes a time when you have to draw comparisons with the
examples and what you have is when you need protection from a power figure and when you do not need the trusted loyal honest and genuine power figure
to intervene. Most of the time its protection of yourself and your own property and your familymembers. So together we think of the world in this way
with Obama being our best shiniest strongest force of good that we have against the forces of brutality, chaos, violence and shadow enemies that
successfully plague us into a worse lived life than what we orginally came to work so hard to achieve as goodlings. Colour and creed and all.
The Obama Foundation from what I have seen is giving anyone a chance, who has worked hard for it and this, a time to be recognized and business
partnered through the process in order to get a better picture of what a community can be and with all of this in unison. With anything like this.
You can see very dark and dangerous times shared with eachother and sometimes beautiful harmonies shared together in happiness and self family made 
prosperity. Shared joyous matters or shared dark times with eachother with family members lost and blood spilled. So the future of the foundation 
is very bright it runs and contributes to multiple charities, it can network exciting business professionals and is doing philantrophic operations
with any form of human beneficial matters. It runs off his name and what he has done to better this world and that America and he is from Chicago 
along with his two beautiful daughters. The former first lady, Michelle, looks to be orchestrating her own wing to this foundation and is an 
accomplished author just like her Husband as he is one of the most desired Black men in this world. Because when you become successful that is what
it comes down to, is how much power you have with the women. We as men measure this up all of the time, and Barack has great power with the women.
The Obama marriage is now at this time, here. It looks like their is some obstacles here and its going strong here. Every marriage gets to a point
where you become the same person it looks like and you have to romanticize more because your getting bored with eachother perphaps. Michelle couldn't 
from the looks of it, be happier. She seems to be straying and wandering and Obama wants less of a professional working partnership
they both want to date more more datenights. You have to keep it fresh. Its hard even if the marriage is good and that stands for us all Americans.
Michelle desperately wants a son-in-law to dress her, talk business and computer science, maybe do some artwork and read some of your poetry.
The entire whole operation seems to be running all is well, with the Obama's using their name and work the bodies of work they have completed
as working professionals and everything that their is alot like other good brand names, if it is on anything, it will succeed. Many good things to
come from a very powerful force of good for this world, as it continues to prosper with its business partners and Michelle and Barack keep 
succeeding as Authors.

So what you are trying to do is that you must be sacrificially gifted. Spiritually rewarded I do believe. That to some artists realist portrait
artwork comes as easy as abstract works of art. Now that I have all of my Abstract illustrations to offer and to show and what it does is incoporate
everything that I have learned, to this day. It means to me what it means to other artists, people and those who want to enjoy a piece of artwork.
This has taken close to fourteen years. I didn't make art all of the time. Colored Pencils, crayons, paints and markers so it takes on a different
expression when it comes to the matter of the piece and what you use as an artist or whats at your disposal. Intially I am showing promise. 
So what I am saying is that when I first saw abstract artwork, I knew that--thank God--that I had a chance to be a painter to be an artist.
And make abstract works of art where I have them shared and hosted now on the Instagram where everyone can see and enjoy for themselves and then
it would be better for us to have, what we are trying to have is a good day together. The best time a body mind and soul can have in this way,
so it can rest and begin anew to its best human body abilities. Turning point. Then to us. This is them. To have this described is that along with 
my abstract artwork you have now together, the Intellectual Property Hero and Insignia. I am pleased to say that we are now very proud to announce
a very very famous and powerful figure has now decided to work with us and use his brand and as an exquisite man to our, his and the worlds 
advantage and he thinks that this is very clientele and very very very business prowess'exciting:09<s.t>:s'_009:09'?/'t. So what this means
is that the Intellectual Property Hero and Insignia is a monumental success and will better the space for artwork and when you need to call
upon, gesture and with action commands, see artwork and come to rest to have say you seen it once or twice or like to look at it once a week or 
even monthly to fulfill your abstract artwork needs.

OBAMA FOUNDATION FUTURE
Its one of the best brands out there. Everybody wants to work with the former 44 POTUS. The Presidential Library which we will be
a branch of the illustrious library system we have in this city and start to bring foot traffic to the far southside out by Hyde Park.
It will have a complete library and have multiple study rooms and meeting places along with its fine art pieces outside near the entrance.
So its quite the tourist attraction in terms of architecture it has to be done in this way and the OBAMA Foundation future rests on it.

Money && BILLS
I think every American Family fits into the same category and that economical category is this, can they each family regardless of what income bracket you
are can that American Family make ends meet. So we have all this in common and we go through every single day in order to secure that we can in fact
make these ends meet and such as.

TURN TALK
I thought he had enough political power to actually turn a presidential debate into what everyone else wants to see. We finally have 3 American leaders
that can simply embody the American will power to get to the solutions with these solutions the human race has in either written thesis or technological
capability. It needs to be an Academic lead debate where the academic systems like the electoral college often reasonable chose the course of the debate and
its no longer a debate but a solution hour of responses from our leaders who are in the only position of helping us live a better day tomorrow and continue our
well being into each of our solitary prosperity. Then you would have this Academic debate where things get done with this polictical discourse and this will
be remembered as once of what we had to express ourselves as a country until that time the American People will only suffer with the rest of the world because
we can't academically come to a variety of solutions with a discussion of what we have on the table.

ART && OBAMA<,COLOR, RACCE.>;
So we have many masterpieces that will accompany the Obama Presidency because it was that successful and so was the 45th POTUS, now sitting, is seen as well.
With 44 and 45 you have two fine American Examples of what a Presidency should be and is was you get that until our current POTUS who was his VP. So we can see
that in artpieces as well. To name recent history and he always had these cues when he was writing history itself its own and he was careful and measured because
we finally had a President that can embody the American People. So in this the Art was expressed. What comes with his body of work will always come more ways to 
express his continued penance with the human population and has art to speak of this for this and will this to the connection that we will share when come time 
to take a memory of ours and do something larger than life because we are now out for ourselves in this argument. So the reason I put the different types and letting,
this is computer science, OBAMA be the array and inside of the array or list or any other data storage you have these two categories, COLOUR && RACE; representing
each a different category and I can command a method to place data saved into any of those two categories of this for an example array labeled OBAMA. So you can write
he is a BLACK MAN and it would come out like so: OBAMA.COLOUR(BLACCK); then the other would be OBAMA.RACE(AFRICAN); then at that time you would have those two descriptions
inside of the OBAMA array from there you can use the data how you would like to program for the rest of the time you need this data.

44th POTUS'*POTUS
Everyone at the end of the day either chooses President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva or President Cyril Ramaphosa or President Emmanuel Macron or President Xi Jinping or The Royal
Salman Family of Saudi Arabia or President Barack Obama because he represents the world that well. He always finishes out at the very top and I think that it is more
difficult to name another one in his place. So for us to be at this point of time in this global day and age of the human race with its society and equally divided world
by country it is telling that you have this type of thought and feelings that stem from it because the world has to be put into this perspective and what is usually achieved
is rather uncommon beit' something to talk about or assure oneself with I don't see any other cause to this one good place of human thinking that we spend our energies on
and what transpires. Is more human feelings that are neither here nor there once again so what we have here is human thinking that isn't going to let us have our working
minds anymore and takes up places of our day that we could use productively and what we battle with is trying to be as productive as I possibly can be and that factors
down to the moments that this area is either strengthened by braun or career work.

OB && OB(JEC)TIVES
I never go into any form of political vote and realize what we are doing as a party and what the polictical outcome will be now with American Politics our leaders
have this confused. What the American People was going for when we vote straight down the line. Is the best of both worlds so you have both of the face to the coin
and dollar for that matter. Put that on the bill and start churning them out for us. That is why you have half and half. One party is designed to face its political
foe in a matter that would be victorious in the same mindset as the other political demonstration that you have on display. We, as the American People, know what
we want and in order to get to that we need our leaders to do these steps and complete them in order to achieve the process. It just doesn't go all by itself we
need to have several methods in place and then once that is done the pieces fall where they may and by political order the system, the peoples, have it all
work out itself and those are our individual objectives and the United States of America Objectives for that matter mattter matters.

WORKPlace && Digestion:Coins:Do It Yourself:-;
With any other topic when you try to balance the subjects with something else that you cannot talk about. It would be a greater show to the spectrum of
human thought. When it is to describe Obama's extent of work done in the WORKPLACE would it be about there. And just what are you describing but a better
relationship for the worker who cannot defend itself against all of the criminal professional employees that we have in the USA alone where if you have the money
anything can be done and bought and paid for as long as no law is broken. So with every form of concupiscence you have ways to market it and make a whole lot
of money from it. So the one human thought and many parts of thought are considered, infinite, would be more of a strange remark then its cold fact of the 
influences of Barack Obama in the workplace. Giving out workplace equality and that workplace an American Citizen will spend most of its life inside. That
life is spent working and the in between is what is deserved and for that you worked for.
