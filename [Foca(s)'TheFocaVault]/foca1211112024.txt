I had a plain day. I thought to myself that I wanted to play something cubed. So cub[ed] I did. S@@@’)t:0/)’you know how it goes(z)’0s’)(t0’){{P}{I}{O}{P};}:-/B;So I sat on down after I picked my perfect game, S@@@’)t, I had it all. The two controllers, had to buy one couldn’t afford well you know you take that from theres. When you went over to a friends house and had not just the one you need to play all fours but he, S@@’ht let us hook up like 8’to this box. Now getting more on to it, it didn’t have those shiny motion sensors, those touch interfaces nor all of the extra buttons this this is brick and mortar it only needed 8 buttons with the directional pad:09’r-0’)::/(v_(z’0))0>:/l:’?/’?/_:0:)rst’ pertaining to all that those games needed[ed], at the time; What a time it was thanks couple levels of Super Mario until it got way 2(wo) hard hard for you and what else, I couldn’t just couldn’t get past that interesting interesting looking James Bond game and Inspector Gadget, we didn’t have Earthworm Jim over here bro. So that will conclude the ‘Roze filled nostalgia days(s)’day(s). The controllers fit the apex-modem-modern look[‘)look]and like I have said to have that tried and tested, turbulent, shelf-(life), like so oh’like so. Is conclusive to its advantage that time and time again, we say this is is a work of a masterpiece and the 100s of games to boot. Now @Nintendo survives off of these brand{‘names. Letting those sell the system it has rather than taking major chances like they did with the iteration that is well known nearly 2(wo)’(wo) generations after. With the swing and pounce and the handheld gaming controller however recent and what the next generation did after this Super @Nintendo. There are no words. Absolutely none. So getting back to it. And getting into those carts’[#’0)carts(0’#]:09>^6.?/’?/’ and creating Real-Life with it. Well I’ll be. It was and continues to be the system that gets the job done, 16-bit style and–16-bit style–it shall be. Whether your just getting into [its] PC-run roms or a different system entirely using that game-engine albeit not on the classic system. Then your helld hands holding the controller began to clam around the long running hold[ed]’hold[ed] controller and the cover work of the multiple games that you would get either wrapped or store-bought gauged-gauged so various forms of excitement that you not only just couldn’t wait to play it but you where, where, involved in these practices so much so that you just wanted to have enough discipline to get past those really [really’)] hard levels and people got drunk to this, F!CKED up to this like so, Margot Robbie.
