For about 30 dollars say, outdoor. The indoor balls are over a 100 dollars
a piece. Then the indoor-outdoor balls are ranging from 30, 40 looks like
to another hunda' dollars a piece. But what you do get is quality and I am 
talkin' brand name. Sweet. Lush. Perfect Balance. To the Touch. Off that
backboard status symbol like the correct @NBA way. Otherwise you can go for
the @Molten || @Baden || @And1 || the classic @Voit || @Jumpman23 || we all
know the @Spalding. @KingJames goes any which one but most likely @Wilson
is the choice. @Nike makes 'em too hard to find tho'.

If we are talkin' this subject it is hard to remember but it is in relation to all 
things geometry which means it is proper to remember what is the distance of this 
current idea which is the definition of a distance between two points but instead of 
a straight line, this one is curved hence its name. Now this is key to remember not 
every single one of these are the same and it does not mean that it is universal for 
every one that you may find to mathematically equate. Is a curved line longer than a 
straight line between the same two points. The straight line would be the shortest 
distance in comparison but for sum examples in the real world you must use a curved 
mathematical exacto necessity. In order to fit around various objects that are mapped
out in the physical space before us and these equations are balanced, how pretty, 
but at the same damn time pruning the curved lines down to the exact amount that 
is necessary which is the total measurement there is, being mathematically identified. 
So everything can then fit in place. @Wolfram_Alpha.
