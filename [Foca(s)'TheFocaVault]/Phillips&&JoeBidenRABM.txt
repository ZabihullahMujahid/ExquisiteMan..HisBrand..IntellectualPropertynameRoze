Tech Company
Its one of the most well known brand names there is the recognition alone sells units.
Personal care->Household Products->Mother & Child Care->Health->Lighting->Sound & Vision->Automotive->Accessories
Anywhere there is technology addition in your daily life Phillips would like to be their for you to assist you in a Phillips
way and there is no nothing else to think about because it has been solved by this technology device and the future for this is
very bright as ever people like to have gadgets, of the Phillips kind, to solve simple household slants and in order to solve for
a "z" your an a "x" looking for that plus'y and that is what Phillips is every single item it has in its inventory is worth buying
for your matter and to have this level of technology adequation would be very Phillips.

Global->United States->Holding Tanks
How these terms are related as you can recieve any form of Phillips product across the world and delivered to you in a timely matter. Then how many
deliveries it constantly makes across the USA would mean that it is one of the top technology companies. Holding tanks are a term for what is inside
can be secured and then monitored once that is done you have a resulting job and object inside like I have said. So that is how a company would deliver
a commodity like a Phillips piece of material to a customer located in the United States and its as soon as possible and it comes from the warehouses and
is shipped out on the delivery trucks or a nearby store for customer pickup and then from their the customer has a relationship with a piece of Phillips 
technology for as long as it can come to work and complete its desired point to the attire of the customer usually its home where it sleeps and eats.

Joe && Beau
His son died fighting. He was one of the family members that served and as you go down like a patriot then the other patriots come together and remember this
patrioit and what he did. He had the same last name as our current President of the United States, his son meant this for our country and the surrounding family
members of both sides for this is what he has done, as the Patriot he was and still is living in infamy as the other Patriots. 


Calculation
Meticulous and measured. Your on the global power scale you have a lot of ties and bindsd that give this country what it is we are trying to as a whole world
remove ourselves from war the wars the drug wars the domestic wars the wars over seas and all of the civil wars. To name a few. We are trying to model ourselves
after the United Nations line by line and country by country. We are trying to as a world live in complete solidarity and from that a tranquility will take place
because sadly we as the savages we are have been at war since we could know what that word means for thousands of years. That is what it has become so difficult
to remove this grave process from our human exercises as we live upon this earth. For thousands and thousands of years. So you learn that nothing is what is simple on
paper translate that easily over into real life you have to grow into the new futures that our leaders must secure with the utensils that our leaders have. So you calculate
the more and more you come to these summations the more you begin to realize is that critical human thinking often measures in two connecting circles and when these
break apart you have the same calculations you was left with in the first place leaving you with the even parts you took to measure one whole again.

Neutral Stand && Protect
This is our only stance with good, we have innocence ours and the law. The law has to stand immobile until you make it bite. What is biting but the response
of the law the human law that we all live under and obey to. What you see in our daily lives with our law is that I try to avoid it as long as I can and have
been successful in not tripping over that wire and once you get to a haven you can see that law is forced to live in the current reality. Where inside the
law-enforcement system do you have the correct grip of reality that would matter down to yours because when it comes knockin' its only going to go one way and
that is the process of law. It doesn't matter if its right its law so you can come to your own decisions later. The reason being is that, law and the law put in 
order exists on a plane of human conciousness that does not exist in our current society of reality that we live in. Law exists on a plane far distant when
we put it in place, Mediveal. This is where law was first concieved around an ancient time of ours and now we live in this day and age with our written work to help us
and our El Opipi-do\v/ illustrious colleges to help our society with this proven human peril.

No more onby cover Then cover
--Then what cover is this. What is then the cover of this, and that. Its always that old saying and you know how that saying goes and this the nearby of what the choice'cover is than this'this is what this means to get old and the needed(ed)neednotneededneed the need'so and then more cover, then this and that."|>.
Tabloids.
--The extent of the coverage of the Biden Family is this. The extent of coverage of the Biden Establishment meaning his Presidency of one complete term in accordance with
the 45th POTUS' one term as the sitting President. It actually comes down to what kind of "Press Package" you recieve because'so it depends on what the newspapers and the
news channels and everything in between, meaning any medium you can access his Presidential agenda and what the 46th POTUS is doing either in leisure or in real-time and 
making one of the most powerful countries decisions to impact domestically and that the world at hand. The world in comparison to its world powers is drawing down the line
of equality but their is always room for more American Exceptionalism. How did his counterpart who he served'served as his VP'{VP} and the need for it that wasn't wrong but it
was all wrong. Then the continuance of the royal desecration, the need for it and also the loss(resulting) from'it. Ah' there she is Nancy Pelosi. His left hand woman. His right
hand buddy. And then buddy. Who was that dog, again?!?v/?' I am not so certain. Then once this is done, Lindsey Graham?
JOE BIDEN'S FAVORITE TOPIC
--He always seems to be talking about something that if he were to sit down and properly be addressed as our current United States President. WHAT SHOULD WE BE ASKING HIM?
Are we asking him the right questions and who do we leave this to, this privilege. Because he can talk about a whole range of issues that are better pertinent to the 
problems we all face as American People. Are their any problems other than the usual?
Joe Biden's Perogative.
--What does he got. What does he have and then this forwards. This forward meaning'meaning what exactly else. Is it something we all have in common. Hey Jill. The thing about this
is that we do not have a correct way to express our human sexuality within our chosen systems, law enforcement the judicial and then finally the political which is this Giant 
Political Mach{(Mach)}ine' that we needed to be it know more so than'ever then needed(ed)f*8^>.m/?':-(;);'
Hairstyle of Joe Biden.
--has always been thinning. Since his twenties. Since his god-knows*:09<,(s).t.>s>.?/'late twenties and the question comes up does he need hair plugs. Not necessarily complete like
others I mean he still has hair and he let it naturally go grey so God knows hes rockin'/it.
Joe Biden's Balding.
--Yes, the normal thinning of the hair, like mine is young, then eventually due to the advancement of the bones no longer needing the skin(the flesh):*09'<,s.>ts.>?/'::?*t'-;
he has the amount of hair that he has, Trump has more hair;
Resume'*{RESUME}:-;
--He has one of the most beautiful of past memories. Political **business **economically refined resume's I have ever seen. It looks like a nickel plated $'.05($'.05)<,m(C).0Cc>.7sz.;?/'':-0')?/'. Almost poetic.
Joe's Poem, poem poetry.
--He is very similar to a poet. Of how he appears. How he uses his legislation. How he appears to use his legislation. When nothing comes falling nothing will come falling down to
the likes of the similar poets. The poor poets. The middle class poets and the rich poets. I mean its really only those 3(thre--ee)*'<s>*t*s:0')--'+'/=?(?)/?/0')="-_'?/'""m/_'-0')--'+'--0F')--'+'?/':-/;"-_0F')'+'?/"-_/'..>FQ?/_'0*F"):-*;?/'categories...
BIDEN.
--Why does his name look this, and remember that. What was needed then that before, that was the gun that was before? That it was needed to be known that it was before. JOE'BIDEN'*(<,s.>*809)'t??':-/;l:**<t.>?/"-/'
Longevity<,.>0;
--Longevity is what is spelled, out. Like a nutrition and the nutrition needed'was the necessary defiance and then you get into the slow grove of it all and the needed'ed that it 
was the long dance before. See, its all about dances. The dances that were necessary before. Dancing is good great for the body you see the differences. The differences that were needed to know what it was the time' time before you had longevity and the necessary*'(9|1/'0)"-_0')"-_/'(P):*/;time that you had before realizing even what you where given'given
and that is what it is. Peserverence or just want to live as some kind of disposable life'leer like a Dorito or something of that grain'herder nature and then spin'ned out. Looking
across the board where is the best longevity or who and he and not only she has achieved longevity.
