"In Due Time"

For we have a collection of mathematical equations. Which are necessary in various sciences, engineering and planetary research. To determine trajectories of objects. As often this is the discussion and of human desire. What you have is a selection of algebraic blocks, variables representing significant points and constants. To represent the symetry of a function in space which is a line and two points, a distance. That the mathematician, Roze, can successfully map out in graphs. Then to properly mathematically realize the slope of the lines which can be determined in phsyics as well. This determines where the object is going and what is doing.

Here you can see a variety of animals in boxes. Because its located in the heart of the city. We all know it isn't humane but how else is Roze going to see wild animals. He needs to. Because in the city everything must be acollated for the determined space, which is small but big enough to fit many things. "Do you catch my drift." Its a beautiful historic zoo. Where as you can see you can sexually chastize a seal. Let it smell. For this place belongs to the animals and noone else. Every child has dreams to work at their local zoo. Please enjoy the traditional circus-style concessions. Get a plastic mold of an animal that will burn a childs hands. A zoo is a good place to watch how, "parents" treat their offspring. During the winters the zoo puts on light shows and family activities. I had a grand memory with a captive vulture here.
