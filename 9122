When Roze looks at the stars outside in our shared sky. Each representing a galaxy he thinks of this. What is my relationship
to the physics, to the chemistry and the biology. Daesin. Human senses in our totality. As Roze knows full well his relationship
with the Sun. It is a very casual, non-chalant and "the usual" form of a biological relationship. However what is the metaphysical?
Actually Roze needs the Sun in order to live. If he didn't. Imagine the world without the Sun. Actually Roze wouldn't even exist. 
As human evolution will tell you as Roze previously showcased, Charles Darwin, to read about. Let Roze hypothesize about these
platonic plates that are composed of molecules, compounds that represent, signify a greater whole, albiet. From space to space.
You will find this space exploration representing what. Our galaxies relation to the others no matter how many light years away.
It takes. It makes. Where Roze will find the same, idea. @NASA

He has given it life. I found a Misfits shirt in a thrift store one time, signed by him. 3 dollars. A steal. He let me know to let it Roll.
As his blues metal is more my style. Yet I find I only beginning to get into the thrash, the speed, the noise metal. Halloween confeetti. 
Grave rock. I need a leather jacket.
