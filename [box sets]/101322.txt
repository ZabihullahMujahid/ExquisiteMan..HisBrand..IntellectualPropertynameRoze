By the way the new Batman is out, ya Robert Pattinson, looks like his career is going well. Did you just see one of his latest magazine covers, ya he 
did the Killing Joke. Because @TheBatman doesn't need to pick sides. When its only the city and hiccups. Remembering that the movie did well. 
So many actors have tried there hand at it and, yes, it was delayed for undisclosed @CIA reasons for some reason.

"Now lets go back to when I had it. Nowsa i'm all at a loss for words. Never cuz' been awhile. And all. 

Whenver. I'm good when you are. You said it. Lets hit it.

Captured the moment. With what. A seeing glass, a digital one. A markup a transfiguration. 

All for me. And here I was like don't start. Now lets be honest. About what?

What would that be. Your axin' once again. I could be yours all mine, and never dress better.

Could of been here the whole time. In fact I was. But what was I doin' when you was lookin' I don't remember. 

Thas' all. Near complete, ya but its never finished. Like sum lexicon. Was that korrect to say and in the correct sences?

What term do you mean. Well I know its a circle. I mean to look outside the box. I photographed myself today."

When you begin to see the trees and not only do I think we are seeing the future, but, once again as I have previously said the sea beckons 
us and to it as we have made various returns to nature that has birthed us as we are only simple land-living creatures and boy did we get 
up and into a rush to deliver a mechanized human race that can support over 7 billion people at one time and we just keep partying and 
partying into the night and thel lights become this hazy and whaterquarter-naut. Then it was done. Repeat once more. I want to take a dive. @USNavy.
