This is Sherman Dilla Thomas "6figga_dilla" currently sharing to'us: our beloved history of @chicago and its historic neighborhoods. That not only have alot of flavour, it is called, cultural history, so to put'it. Our neighborhoods of this city of @Chicago describe how each and every ethnicity is currently:living. In and every day-out. And not only does each neighborhood, have its own style. But tourist attractions and many things, to-be-seen, that each and every neighborhood has to market and is effectively known for and what stems from'it. Its people, that live in it. It has been said Chicago is segregated in each of its neighborhoods, but really to put in perspective it is more of a comfortable and a formal segregation, meaning you live with your people and by and around them. To further your ties of your own making and creed. That is why @chicago is brimming with interesting historic subjects.

"Then when he speaking, to all.
Did it mean what I think it did, did it then mean!?
The last time.
I don't know.

But what do you mean, anymore.
Then it was the same as the last time.
Then that means it was the last, same-damn-time.
If these buses can run on time.

But sometimes.
Sometimes, once again.
We need to wait for everybody that bought a ticket
Let us give'it a couple more minutes maybe, maybe once more dey'show'on'up.
Perhaps they on-do. Maybe on-not once more and once again.
If'not the show, I give, must go'on.

And it 'on,' it'does'so,
I Call it. The nevermind but I don't forget it.
Because..
"Everything good comes from @chicago."
Thats why merch[]v:'?/{+=}[/]:;"'P"

Now we are on this subject. As it has moved on'. Does anyone'else want to show their deep resonating brevity of their personal acquired knowledge of Maritime History. How about Paleography? Or even 'Digital History.' What a time and effort, and rewarding subject this:is. As I have previously said, we have conquered all of our lands and utilized them fully of their resources. But have we done the same, with our waters? All of the lands and its peoples that are a product of their own land. Separated, each and own, in their own once again respective countries. I just described, 'World History' finding its place in the history of geography. As you can tell I am deeply entrenched within Historiography and all of it parts. That tie-in, that represent. Like one of our most famous chicagoans, once again "6figga Dilla" as he touches upon, 'Cultural History' as well. Did you need help purchasing a ticket. And it looks like the bus, takes off str8 from the, "DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center." Sothatwouldbeit. But what really intrigues me about history, is that not only is this is what is remembered, what has been destroyed, because of these said reasons, is never to be antiquated in the same process. In some cases lost forever, and almost a history in itself, of this type of desecration. Leading to the loss of words from great thinkers, great cultures that helped shape us, form us and not only that but helped us survive throughout the ages. Further meaning an archaeology of our history: which is a play-off the title of my teacher, now deceased, Michel Foucault: entitled the "The Archaeology of Knowledge." And once again this ties into historiography. Once more. So you begin to see the same platitudes and as always, in similarity. But also notice the stark differences that empower'us and makes us stronger as one, and then be able to decipher us, homo-sapiens, better as a collective-whole.
