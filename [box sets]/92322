When the time comes what do you do? Roze just stands around and there isn't much
to say much to do or much about that at all. So Roze always proceeds to think
about something else to occupy his time and his own desire. There would be to
many things to think about when or if Roze would hang onto these thoughts and
the come to his own formulas in his head. So he would continue on and come to 
his own matters. At hand. There you would find yourself alot like Roze in 
your own position in your own life whoever that may concern at this time 
and in these quarters where there are people with the turnkey. I see.
Well. There it was all gone to begin another and they become all constants.
And stanzas. Formulas, like I said. Then eventually functions. As we are
taking the measurements of what is around us and what is the current position

"Well. Tell me how you like it. I said to be come on over and think about it with me.
There I was all alone and now your going to see where it was before but does that
matter. Only to me. There wasn't even a matter before you always make it matter.
What would it then be to me? Is it all that I got. Before. You was there. Right
I had say there honcho and bunches. Like I said there I was mindin' my own
business." @chipublib.


I love the butter finish. Don't you. Take it down. Wash it around you mouth.
Your inner sin. There I was the beer and me and thats all I needed I like to 
make it go down with a dellcy moke of tiggeroonies. There I was. Enjoyin' one
of wisconsins very own very proudly owned and very responsible I remember 
when drunkin' drivin' went down. Amen to that. Who was the pursen who 
got that out of our picture, collectively. Then you go around to each bar
ya beast and your open to anything happenin' and you can throw down the 
best ya can. It always goes down so easy. @oldstylebeer.
