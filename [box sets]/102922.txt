When I said it then said it once more. And I could find my self all cuddled up, all snuggled up and in the pain't of the house and everything around me, once again perhaps a snack or 2. Maybe a 'dink. But whose lookin' there it was once more, my all-time favourite game I would want to like to play for'it that is the competition within myself to best see. Just see. How well the video game can play-out. How best to explore it and when the original, the super, the 64, the motion controls Wii and now this latest iteration has on done come out in 2017. So. Theres that. So begins.

"Well, for what its worth I was there. But where was you, exactly?

On the night. That we all know, and hold dear, like a quaint.

But not exactly. More like a steer, and a snake. And some cousin of the Llama.

Whereever I had it I like to know it. Never to be known before. But. But.

Once time more. All I could guess. Was this all that I could know was this. Whenever I had it. 

I had it like this. I want it like this. I want you to show it like this. Thas' good for now. 

So I said it. There it was all in the disarray. But could I install it, light it?

Perhaps."

I always find'so ever'once again'so interesting entrancing, formulating within' my mind that we once held one of these, babies, to a hot and boil of a fire. In order to forge steel, yet even make meals. And the women would then take care of us in the woods, the castles, the log cabins off the dreary path and feed all of us. Because it was easier to make bigger meals for all the soldiers and their families and complete the day with a good and hearty meal. Boil more on down to the next pace of the like. And I found myself, part of the metal. There I was. There was the meal for today.
