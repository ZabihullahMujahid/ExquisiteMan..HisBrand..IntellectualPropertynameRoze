There will be a good day. A day to reminder. Of what this is for, families. That is correct from one and all. The ones that can't necessarily afford anything a 
rich family can but those in riches use it as well. Because they like the accessability and the amount of offering variation what have you. The ease of access 
for whatever just whatever once again, you would like. You name it. I haven't been into the garden side. No I never venture out that far. In here. I have 
never gone up and down, one by one, just to see. If @Walmart effectively or eventually or in fact does, have everything.

"So what would it take.
The time away.
The time gone.

The hands that are over.
The same time, that it was before.
And once again.

Then need for it, wasn't as great as the need for it'was,
that it was once was and once again and once more, what.


The need at it.
The clamour. The destined. The all amount.

That I thought that it was, effectively, that I need; to amount, once again. The need for:it'the clamour, once more.

Then the get again." @The New York Times. @NEIU.

So I took a look at one. The need for one, that I remember. I always think about that movie, that advertised it. Another never-ending dream, frame of mindset, 
stuck so brutally stuck in my mind that I need a cleaner. Some kind of retribution, some kind of rewind, albiet, no a clear-state-of-mind. So nothing is in 
fact in my mind, these recurring memories of mine that I am forced to think-about then again, there is many and I am sure you will think of yours and I have, 
once again mine. I love how it repels water to its advantages. I love how the motor is under the boat, your sitting on it, right. It uses the body of water to 
its system. The more you have, the better it will guide itself, with its built-in motor, like I have said. Then the speeds it can go up to and companies even 
have professional races. And some movies have jet-ski stunts like I have said before, as we often go play-by-play. The need for it, once more. I think that 
personal watercrafts, are relatively new so that is very exciting as these companies offer it, and there is some brand names, and some are necessarily defunct 
and thats all. The need for it once more and once again. Because it only symbolizes your personal happiness, unlike a car of yours. Roze only goes on a jet-ski 
for water leisure and usually it comes along with a private ocean or lake house. And that is where we live, by the Lake. Lake Michigan. And when you see citizens 
on them, out there, it takes notice. And everyone goes, I want one. Or how many bitches Roze can fit on one, but let us remember: at most two of his, because it 
has to be enjoyable for all parties involved. And sometimes you must showcase, personal watercraft safety, and you have to be specially trained for such a, "craft." 
Before you go on one of your stunt-rides. So that is good to remember as well, Roze. Here you go. :||w'z.> ?/:wut?"
