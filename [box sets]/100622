When we say hi and goodbye and is it okay as always and when it isn't shouldn't 
I have been at least notified and with all the causes that would make this another
best man kind of tonic. Water has always been on my top to do branches and refining
myself once more, I said it to myself. The other day. When I had. Which brings me
this quotion. Should this be here and what if it did and what brung it to this 
point and for what purposes. Is it another one of them same patterns then my brain
would recognize it as a primal underling then my Shaun begins to decipher and we
together, the thought and I, come to the complete end where I can use it once more.
Because if it is in repetition than I would know myself and what actions I am 
then contributing towards, once again, in order to complete the next task.

"I was thinkin', Today, Then I wasn't thinkin' anymore, Today, And I thought well
gosh so handsome.

Then I had another thought, And it came on, and I was suppostal going to the center,
where everything is.

What can be bought now. Is it important, ya. Ok well why don't u get it on the way out.
Well lets warm your bedside.

Had another toke and I brought it on myself. To think about what happened. Then woke
up in a @mcdonalds and ordered a one-rino. Had myself a time.

Now take it on back. Does it matter to me. Does it matter to you. Then who sould it
matter towards.
