When I get in there and I listen to this album in Totality it reminds me who I am, which Spirits I personally am in touch with and it emboldens me with great Power to know that I am Heaven, Hell and the Underworld and Darkness is me and I am it. I am walking Darkness which is Light. "Hell is my name." To because this is what it takes, these forces that we are all under which is these forces of nature and what it does to the females as they serve their purposes and this is what they like to do, dance to it and feel very sexy while its being played. This is also the embodied work of William Shakespeare. Very well. @metal_archives. @nuclearblast.

I would like to get down to it as Roze is always ever so interested in how things came to be. This however is the measurement of exact points in space for this came to be in order to be able to decide, determine and map out what these relations are in circumference, radii and plateus in equidistance from eachother these two points. So when it comes to understanding the white space and the located, written and acknowledgedly logged two points in a representation of a system or if it is only a point. Then where is its numerical location in response in comparison to the usual, the norlmacy and once again the standard model. It then gave rise to Roze desiring to study these 4 other subjects that you see above this remark. Which I will reach and touch upon at a later time. @Wolfram_Alpha. @neiucs. @HW_College. @Wikipedia.
