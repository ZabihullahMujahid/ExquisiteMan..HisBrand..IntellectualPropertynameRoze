I love seeing, visiting the sto*re. I love'that'place. I feel in control But I acutally know my time and place. For better instance and on second thought*this. That this, would be the perfect shoe. Theperfecthat. The more'that'I'think aboutit. The more that I claudrofine' myself to be'known'better than myself. Because once again, this is about style. My personal style and I know that there is a perfect shoe and a perfect hat forme. Like I have said. The sto' on the Magnificent Mile in the loop, Downtown. Is multi-level leaving you with no choice, or is it disturbing*perhaps Question*s? The thing aboutitis. That all the so. So. I pickitout. For I saved my money. Andall and I wear them til*dey snap and I can no longer wear them because of many weather conditions. But boy, did I get my*use out of*em. See that swoosh. See how that colour*plays. Well. @Nike.

"It has become to consant table.
When we forgot all.
When its hardships and resignations.
And all that was forgot.
Was to be simply, named.
Now don't forget your boots.
I have a fetish for women wearing boots.
Fetish is a weird, strange, defiable word.
When it is put to good use.
There
There's Rozes' sexuality all out there for you to see.
However it is what you think it is.
Has become.
And for shall ever be."

So notice. Do I notice. My place in this world. Where I could'be where I could make my'mark. But'whatisthis'that I could'be'possibly'seeing. Is this Real. Is this in-animate. Object. Objects. To be more objects and no more place in this world, but a place where a human medical scientist is, with heavily favouring biology aspects, and its response with the medical tools. That we have at hand. And you can go up and down and in-fact lay them all out for everyone to see. And just'what doyouthenhave? Here. A more complete picture. A more complete model of whatthis is and it means to be a doctor, tobe a bio-medical engineer persay, in this world of ours, shared alongside and asa product of Mother Gaia. Dare I know'it. More than myself, I sure do. Thereitis.
