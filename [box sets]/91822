It has become an ever so interesting axiom of ours and very
fastidious and very ordered and some and most end in dire gunfirefights
and complete what circumstance the attacker or group of attackers need 
to necessarily take place and need to happen. As you can see in movies,
the Taker, can actually get the @Chicago_Police, the @FBI, the @CIA,
the @SecretService, the @CCSOPIO and the @USMarshalsHQ to work with
their advantage in a form of heightened-human-emotional-damage where it
is either life of death. And circumstances usually happen in this way.
And in trying to protect themselves and oneself against the danger 
and violence and ultimate human mortal outcomes that might happen
if they do anything against, the Taker. Who is now their Bringer
of Safety and their Protection, their Bringer of Mortal Harm and finally
their very own Bringer of thy Death. Now what exactly can they use to
their, once again, human avantage. Because inside of this criminal-espionage-situation,
they are in fact in compelete control. This is also a very interesting
term of phrase and what a criminal can do is apply this, axiom,
to anywhere it ever so shall be deemed of use to their profit,
once more to its human advantage and their criminal's necessity 
which means its going to be ahead of the game. Because when it comes
down to it, when the matter kounts for the last time. We all know. 
It doesn't come down to mind, body nor braun but the one who has the
best plan of attack and in the best position to attack upon the perfect
example of human prey.

When I get a bowl of this. God. Do I remember all the good times.
And the good times to be had. However how long those have last in 
its... howeverity. Just the right amount of thy sugar. Not too
heavy. Ever so notcha to light. Then the milk hits and usually
I go with the 2% @jewelosco brand, of course. Of course. Then
the spoon is usually metal and the bowl, I'm fine with just
plastic nothing formal more of a taste is in their rather than
a fine piece of china. And necessarily the big spoon nothing small.
Because this is breakfast. And might I have the toast, rye or 
the multi-grain with thy butter and a perfect mug of the 
darkest coffee they will find. Once more a fine juice to 
go with perhaps even a smoothie but thats a splurge.
