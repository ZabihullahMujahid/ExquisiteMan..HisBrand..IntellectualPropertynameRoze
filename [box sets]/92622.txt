Hmm. I desire to know everything I do not know. I like how it is yet so
insormountable to understand yet at the same time and through the history which is our shared history with the planets, 
solar system and this living universe of ours. Also dead. The metaphysical qaulities and I will say it again. Dasein. To be 
know is what is to know more of our current understanding as to what was before when we knew nothing about it, yet it became simple, 
for we loved it. A charm. This way now now we wish to properly utilize it as we live in this, primordial ooze.

Do you desire to descend into acadamia?

I have cherished this series for so long and, whats the tally. It looks at 73 and counting, beatifully well crafted and 
art filled books where you wil recieve off-center or slap-stick comedy and at times the coveted off-kilter and its just a 
man and his cat, who has become one of the most beloved comic characters in this universe. Written by a guy we all know, Jim Davis. 
I always like to religously, get the latest strip in our local, Chicago @SunTimes, thank you.
