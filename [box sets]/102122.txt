.?When I had the time of the day when I had it all was the mine. But what was the mine. To be known as such as the known as it since was/ Then I didn't have it like the last. No. Like the last time that I had it last. No. No, and then more-sum. Because the sum is greater than the parts, as they say. Some parts are worth more than others. Yes, but let us get to the other way the other kind of way that this is to be kneeded. Also which is the way and is the play on words. A pun, some call it.

I love it. Ok. I can't wait to play it. Set my handsonit. Sum of us people, have to wait until are friends who are more "monetary stable" in order to playit' I also am at a loss, because playing new kinds of systems are no-longer a thing of the past? That is the past, now. And the arcades are gone, or sum are still on-up these days. And it comes down to @Nintendo, @Xbox those 3 and what @GabeNewell and @Steam are doing these days/ So handheld is the way console is the way and then finally the arcade is still'kickin'" so that is the way as well, once again as the say. Don't just do it look good? It looks so good, that I can't once again wait to play-it. Its a good online experience its immersive if I have learned anything from the likes of @Sony @Playstation compared to the other system offerings and in this latest generation, that is currently offering to us. With househould names meaning the long-standing video-game-series in this place and offering as I have said. Virtual reality means it is all that can be seen, it means your lost into a complete creation of a video-game world. The classic "DualSense" wireless controller has touch-pads so you can express your video-game existence in this way and that way and have better control when you need to slide your hand over rather than press or hold any of the other buttons and joysticks. Then we have the "HD Camera" which immerses the outside world with your digital world, marrying the two into more of an immersive experience, once again. @Playstation.
