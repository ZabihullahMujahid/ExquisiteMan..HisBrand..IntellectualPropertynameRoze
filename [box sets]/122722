I take one and I have another. I join it with the other crumbs in my 
mouth and as the saying goes. Have they changed their chip formula. The
bag I see, has'been modernized. But at least from what I can say. Who
is going into all of the chip companies from @FritoLay to others. And
saying, what we need is them to taste more like cracker and milk. Milky.
Are you dead serious. Back when I had these and nowadays. Well, its a mixed
bag sometimes and I continue on because they are trying new things and other
like that and the need for them. Mine. Has only increased. @Doritos.

You know what like Danzig, and all?

But nothing was on my last Christmas list for late last year.

And then I only really only wanna want one thing.
Is it that.
Something for a reason to liveby.
And all.

And all I got was the dance
once again, at hand and did you see it.
There once more, before us all?

Did you get it?
For Christmas that is.
There it was, for all of us.
Right placed ahead of us before we have never not seen it yet,
there it was for all of us to, once again, have.

And whaddayawousf'ahadada-know'd it?

Then I had it once before.

Once more.
Well when I got it when I had it what did I have in the first place.

Did you see?

Once more. We can be friends.
Let us seperate business from pleasure."
