Something about it. That this place only exists for one purpose. Our purpose. And this is, it is a little off the beaten path and then once you get into this environment your taken away into a dream-like experience and state of mind. Because when Roze got there, for he wanted to scale each and every waterslide that there was, but towards the end of the day I learned that it was impossible, I had to let sum go, well with all of the lines leading to the slides and all. I had to wait. I would of had to spend an entire 3-day weekend there. Thats what its like to goto one of these places. @Disney

"Look at the purpose. Look at all those places. As we take the time away. From us and share it inside a waterpark. This waterpark. Where I can stroll at my leisure to the "Avalunch" and the "Lottawatta Lodge." How endearing, how genuine, what a time saver. This we can do. That slide we can go on. For the day seems endless and the fun never stops. I can tell you what doesn't last, the nachos with chees and the soda pop for one." @chipublib.

When I first heard this term, to my eyes and ears, my sensual temporal ears that is, my reading gaze. For my human mind, understood it, and I thought Foucault was talking about some kind of interesting-rather expansive-exploring-figurative human submarine of knowledges and we were going, and we have to, and we are in the process of transversing which of what we do not understand, and why? That is. All that there is. To be the best at it and in the image of our own perfection. This. This is what we all strive for and from this precipice, let us, embark once more. Down the lane. Down trodden yet hopeful filled with light and what makes us, each one of us, dark. One more time.
