So I took a look around, found out it was in fact all the way down Montrose. I'm talking all the way down. Down there. I would, like I said, take the 80. 
Crossover a coupla'blocks. And then get started. This is one of the city colleges of this great city. That emphasizes in science and engineering. This is 
table'blocks? No, sorry I meant, what I meant once again was, building blocks. Of discourse. Correct laying foundations of all that is near, your touch, 
your scientific soul and your futures. Here. This here. One great example of a Chicago Community City College. Here you can get a variety of degrees. 
Most likely an Associates of a specific designation, that you would then take, and you should, to get a Bachelor's like I did, at my alma mater @NEIU. 
Once you recieve these classes, paying them with @FAFSA, your going to get more than just the grit. You get widely-rooted in American @History, a city 
filled with respect, nomenclature, culture and divided ethnicity. You get started off rite. Thatt is for sure.

So what you have is two scientific paradigms. The one being, is that. What is this. How does this respond. To the scientific method. Does it necessarily 
leave after fitting under? And what does come. What comes from it. Because science, when you factor it down to its barest quantities. What you have is simple, 
cause and effect. What is usually before the first. There would entail the explanation. The purpose of this scientific discovery. Is to respond to what we do 
not in fact know but all that is yet to be understood. That is why, very why, that we need to peform this human operation, living under unexplained determinations.
And mostly, we have yet to come to any factual conclusions that we have yet to understand. Meaning, what we knew before was a mystery to'us. For, we had no idea it 
existed to us'yet. Catch my drift. And now it has become, formal, apart of us, because like I have said it is now, understood...Before we could only.
