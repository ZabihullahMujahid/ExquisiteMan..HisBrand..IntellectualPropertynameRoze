" In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry."

"Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus."

"One component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences."

--"Aristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric."

"Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē (soul) in accordance with reason (logos)."

"The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy."

"Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology."

--Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.

The English mathematician <:George Boole:> fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided "to go under, over, and beyond" it with his system of algebraic logic <<:?/"'{:|}in his 1854 book The Laws of Thought.>>:?/

"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle".[187][188] Also, in later editions of the book "On the Origin of Species',
Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle;[189] the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles.

--Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual,
"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part".

He famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal" and argued that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.
